// opt #135: AgentHarness.emitAny/emitOwn/emitHook iterated the LIVE subscriber
// Set (`for (const listener of this.getHandlers(SUBSCRIBER_EVENT_TYPE) ?? [])`).
// A listener that called subscribe() / the returned unsubscribe() during its
// own callback mutated that Set mid-iteration — and concurrent emitAny
// invocations from the parallel tool batch exposed two iterators to each
// other's mutations. V8 visits a Set entry added during iteration if the
// iterator hasn't passed it, so a handler registered mid-event would receive
// that SAME event (wrong), and a delete could skip a not-yet-visited handler
// or throw `Set modified during iteration`. The fix snapshots the handlers
// (Array.from) before iterating so mid-emit (un)subscribes only affect LATER
// events. This test registers listener2 from inside listener1's first callback
// and asserts listener2 does NOT receive the event it was registered during.
