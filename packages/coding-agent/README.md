# REPI Coding Agent

**REPI is the runnable reverse / pentest harness agent.** It maps targets, executes real tools, verifies claims, writes evidence, and keeps upstream `pi` isolated: command is `repi`, profile is `~/.repi/agent`, and normal `pi` / `~/.pi` are not owned by REPI.

The npm/bin entry boots straight into the REPI kernel: reverse/pentest prompts, `/goal`, evidence ledgers, verifier → compiler → replayer → autofix proof-loop, runtime adapters, extension compatibility, and profile initialization are all product defaults.

## Quick Start

Recommended source installer:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/multi-zhangyang/pi-recon-agent/main/install.sh | bash
```

Local checkout refresh:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/multi-zhangyang/pi-recon-agent.git
cd pi-recon-agent
npm install --ignore-scripts
bash install.sh
```

Release tarball install uses the four same-version GitHub Release packages together; do not install only `@pi-recon/repi-coding-agent` unless the matching `@pi-recon/*` packages are published for that exact version.

```bash
npm install -g \
  pi-recon-repi-ai-0.1.2.tgz \
  pi-recon-repi-agent-core-0.1.2.tgz \
  pi-recon-repi-tui-0.1.2.tgz \
  pi-recon-repi-coding-agent-0.1.2.tgz
```

The source installer writes a `repi` launcher into an existing PATH directory when possible (`/usr/local/bin` / `/usr/local/sbin`, with sudo if available). If it falls back to `~/.local/bin`, it creates/updates `.bashrc`/`.profile` (or `.zshrc`/`.profile`) and prints the exact next command, for example:

```text
■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■ 100%
Successfully added repi to $PATH in ~/.bashrc

REPI 0.1.2 installed successfully, to start:

source ~/.bashrc  # Load new PATH (or open a new terminal)
cd <project>  # Open directory
repi          # Run command
```

Configure a model with REPI's Claude Code-style env-only path:

```bash
export REPI_AUTH_TOKEN="sk-..."
export REPI_BASE_URL="https://gateway.example/v1"
export REPI_PROVIDER="gateway"              # optional; footer/provider id, default: repi-env
export REPI_MODEL="vendor/model-id"
export REPI_MODEL_API="openai-compatible"   # openai-compatible | openai-responses | anthropic
export REPI_CONTEXT_WINDOW=262144
export REPI_AUTO_COMPACT_WINDOW=262144

repi model status
repi doctor
repi
```

Goal mode is built in: use `/goal [--tokens 100k] <objective>` and watch the footer `🎯 active/paused/budget/complete` plus the status progress bar; the agent stops only after `goal_complete` verifies the goal. Install upstream pi ecosystem packages when needed:

```bash
repi install npm:pi-web-access
```

Then start with `/goal <objective>`, `/re-profile-check quick`, `/re-map <target> 2`, `/re-operator plan <target>`, `/re-verifier matrix`, and `/re-complete audit`. REPI still exposes standard `read`, `write`, `edit`, and `bash`, but its default system prompt and commands are the REPI reverse/pentest control plane.

Release readiness is continuously checked with real, runnable scenarios:

- Native reverse: a stripped `crackme` was solved end-to-end and verified with live execution.
- Web/API authz: a local API IDOR/BOLA was proven with live HTTP requests and reusable PoC evidence.
- PCAP/DFIR: a `capture.pcap` was carved with `tshark`, the real 200-flow flag/credentials were recovered, and a 404 decoy was excluded.

Those runs directly hardened route precedence (`capture.pcap`/URL/binary targets beat harness-feedback wording), route-specific mission checkpoints, and `re_techniques` aliases such as `web-api-authz` and `pcap-dfir-carve`.

## Providers & Models

REPI does not load upstream pi's large built-in provider/model catalog by default (`REPI_LOAD_BUILTIN_MODELS=0`). The normal runtime surface is:

- `REPI_AUTH_TOKEN` + `REPI_BASE_URL` + `REPI_MODEL` (+ `REPI_MODEL_API`) for env-only one-off switching.
- `~/.repi/agent/models.json` for persistent OpenAI-compatible, Responses-compatible, Anthropic-compatible, local runtime, or gateway configs.
- Dynamically registered providers from extensions.

Set `REPI_LOAD_BUILTIN_MODELS=1` only when you intentionally need upstream pi legacy provider discovery.

**Custom providers & models:** Add providers via `~/.repi/agent/models.json` if they speak a supported API (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google). For custom APIs or OAuth, use extensions. See [docs/models.md](docs/models.md) and [docs/custom-provider.md](docs/custom-provider.md).

---

## Interactive Mode

<p align="center"><img src="docs/images/interactive-mode.png" alt="Interactive Mode" width="600"></p>

The interface from top to bottom:

- **Startup header** - Shows shortcuts (`/hotkeys` for all), loaded AGENTS.md files, prompt templates, skills, and extensions
- **Messages** - Your messages, assistant responses, tool calls and results, notifications, errors, and extension UI
- **Editor** - Where you type; border color indicates thinking level
- **Footer** - Working directory, session name, total token/cache usage (`↑` input, `↓` output, `R` cache read, `W` cache write, `CH` latest cache hit rate), cost, context usage, current model

The editor can be temporarily replaced by other UI, like built-in `/settings` or custom UI from extensions (e.g., a Q&A tool that lets the user answer model questions in a structured format). [Extensions](#extensions) can also replace the editor, add widgets above/below it, a status line, custom footer, or overlays.

### Editor

| Feature | How |
|---------|-----|
| File reference | Type `@` to fuzzy-search project files |
| Path completion | Tab to complete paths |
| Multi-line | Shift+Enter (or Ctrl+Enter on Windows Terminal) |
| Images | Ctrl+V to paste (Alt+V on Windows), or drag onto terminal |
| Bash commands | `!command` runs and sends output to LLM, `!!command` runs without sending |

Standard editing keybindings for delete word, undo, etc. See [docs/keybindings.md](docs/keybindings.md).

### Commands

Type `/` in the editor to trigger commands. [Extensions](#extensions) can register custom commands, [skills](#skills) are available as `/skill:name`, and [prompt templates](#prompt-templates) expand via `/templatename`.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/login`, `/logout` | OAuth authentication |
| `/model` | Switch models |
| `/scoped-models` | Enable/disable models for Ctrl+P cycling |
| `/settings` | Thinking level, theme, message delivery, transport |
| `/resume` | Pick from previous sessions |
| `/new` | Start a new session |
| `/name <name>` | Set session display name |
| `/session` | Show session info (file, ID, messages, tokens, cost) |
| `/tree` | Jump to any point in the session and continue from there |
| `/trust` | Save project trust decision for future sessions (restart required) |
| `/fork` | Create a new session from a previous user message |
| `/clone` | Duplicate the current active branch into a new session |
| `/compact [prompt]` | Manually compact context, optional custom instructions |
| `/copy` | Copy last assistant message to clipboard |
| `/export [file]` | Export session to HTML file |
| `/share` | Upload as private GitHub gist with shareable HTML link |
| `/reload` | Reload keybindings, extensions, skills, prompts, and context files (themes hot-reload automatically) |
| `/hotkeys` | Show all keyboard shortcuts |
| `/changelog` | Display version history |
| `/quit` | Quit repi |

### Keyboard Shortcuts

See `/hotkeys` for the full list. Customize via `~/.repi/agent/keybindings.json`. See [docs/keybindings.md](docs/keybindings.md).

**Commonly used:**

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Ctrl+C | Clear editor |
| Ctrl+C twice | Quit |
| Escape | Cancel/abort |
| Escape twice | Open `/tree` |
| Ctrl+L | Open model selector |
| Ctrl+P / Shift+Ctrl+P | Cycle scoped models forward/backward |
| Shift+Tab | Cycle thinking level |
| Ctrl+O | Collapse/expand tool output |
| Ctrl+T | Collapse/expand thinking blocks |

### Message Queue

Submit messages while the agent is working:

- **Enter** queues a *steering* message, delivered after the current assistant turn finishes executing its tool calls
- **Alt+Enter** queues a *follow-up* message, delivered only after the agent finishes all work
- **Escape** aborts and restores queued messages to editor
- **Alt+Up** retrieves queued messages back to editor

On Windows Terminal, `Alt+Enter` is fullscreen by default. Remap it in [docs/terminal-setup.md](docs/terminal-setup.md) so repi can receive the follow-up shortcut.

Configure delivery in [settings](docs/settings.md): `steeringMode` and `followUpMode` can be `"one-at-a-time"` (default, waits for response) or `"all"` (delivers all queued at once). `transport` selects provider transport preference (`"sse"`, `"websocket"`, or `"auto"`) for providers that support multiple transports.

---

## Sessions

Sessions are stored as JSONL files with a tree structure. Each entry has an `id` and `parentId`, enabling in-place branching without creating new files. See [docs/session-format.md](docs/session-format.md) for file format.

### Management

Sessions auto-save to `~/.repi/agent/sessions/` organized by working directory.

```bash
repi -c                  # Continue most recent session
repi -r                  # Browse and select from past sessions
repi --no-session        # Ephemeral mode (don't save)
repi --name "my task"    # Set session display name at startup
repi --session <path|id> # Use specific session file or ID
repi --fork <path|id>    # Fork specific session file or ID into a new session
```

Use `/session` in interactive mode to see the current session ID before reusing it with `--session <id>` or `--fork <id>`.

### Branching

**`/tree`** - Navigate the session tree in-place. Select any previous point, continue from there, and switch between branches. All history preserved in a single file.

<p align="center"><img src="docs/images/tree-view.png" alt="Tree View" width="600"></p>

- Search by typing, fold/unfold and jump between branches with Ctrl+←/Ctrl+→ or Alt+←/Alt+→, page with ←/→
- Filter modes (Ctrl+O): default → no-tools → user-only → labeled-only → all
- Press Shift+L to label entries as bookmarks and Shift+T to toggle label timestamps

**`/fork`** - Create a new session file from a previous user message on the active branch. Opens a selector, copies the active path up to that point, and places the selected prompt in the editor for modification.

**`/clone`** - Duplicate the current active branch into a new session file at the current position. The new session keeps the full active-path history and opens with an empty editor.

**`--fork <path|id>`** - Fork an existing session file or partial session UUID directly from the CLI. This copies the full source session into a new session file in the current project.

### Compaction

Long sessions can exhaust context windows. Compaction summarizes older messages while keeping recent ones.

**Manual:** `/compact` or `/compact <custom instructions>`

**Automatic:** Enabled by default. Triggers on context overflow (recovers and retries) or when approaching the limit (proactive). Configure via `/settings` or `settings.json`.

Compaction is lossy. The full history remains in the JSONL file; use `/tree` to revisit. Customize compaction behavior via [extensions](#extensions). See [docs/compaction.md](docs/compaction.md) for internals.

---

## Settings

Use `/settings` to modify common options, or edit JSON files directly:

| Location | Scope |
|----------|-------|
| `~/.repi/agent/settings.json` | Global (all projects) |
| `.repi/settings.json` | Project (overrides global) |

See [docs/settings.md](docs/settings.md) for all options.

### Project Trust

On interactive startup, repi asks before trusting a project folder that contains project-local inputs and has no saved decision in `~/.repi/agent/trust.json`. Trusting a project allows repi to read project instructions (`AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`), load `.repi/settings.json` and `.repi` resources, install missing project packages, and execute project extensions.

Non-interactive modes (`-p`, `--mode json`, and `--mode rpc`) do not show a trust prompt. Without a saved trust decision, they ignore project-local inputs unless `--approve`/`-a` is passed. Use `--no-approve`/`-na` to ignore project-local inputs for one run even when the project is trusted.

`repi config` assumes project trust for that command so you can view and change project resource settings before starting a session. It does not save a trust decision; starting a session in that folder still prompts. Pass `--no-approve` to hide project-local inputs in `repi config`.

Use `/trust` in interactive mode to save a project trust decision for future sessions. It writes `~/.repi/agent/trust.json` only; the current session is not reloaded, so restart repi for changes to take effect.

### Telemetry and update checks

REPI product mode disables upstream update checks and install telemetry by default. The inherited compatibility code has two startup features only when the CLI is not running as REPI:

- **Update check:** disabled in REPI product mode. For non-REPI compatibility runs, disable it with the legacy skip-version-check environment flag.
- **Install/update telemetry:** disabled in REPI product mode. Provider attribution headers remain controlled by provider-specific settings and do not require upstream update telemetry.

Use `--offline` or `REPI_OFFLINE=1` to disable startup network operations such as package update checks and install/update telemetry.

---

## Context Files

REPI loads `AGENTS.md` (or `CLAUDE.md`) at startup from:
- `~/.repi/agent/AGENTS.md` (global)
- Parent directories (walking up from cwd, only when the project is trusted)
- Current directory (only when the project is trusted)

Use for project instructions (`AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`), conventions, common commands. All matching files are concatenated.

Disable context file loading with `--no-context-files` (or `-nc`).

### System Prompt

Replace the default system prompt with `.repi/SYSTEM.md` (project) or `~/.repi/agent/SYSTEM.md` (global). Append without replacing via `APPEND_SYSTEM.md`.

---

## Customization

### Prompt Templates

Reusable prompts as Markdown files. Type `/name` to expand.

```markdown
<!-- ~/.repi/agent/prompts/review.md -->
Review this code for bugs, security issues, and performance problems.
Focus on: {{focus}}
```

Place in `~/.repi/agent/prompts/`, `.repi/prompts/`, or a [repi package](#repi-packages) to share with others. See [docs/prompt-templates.md](docs/prompt-templates.md).

### Skills

On-demand capability packages following the [Agent Skills standard](https://agentskills.io). Invoke via `/skill:name` or let the agent load them automatically.

```markdown
<!-- ~/.repi/agent/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md -->
# My Skill
Use this skill when the user asks about X.

## Steps
1. Do this
2. Then that
```

Place in `~/.repi/agent/skills/`, `~/.agents/skills/`, `.repi/skills/`, or `.agents/skills/` (from `cwd` up through parent directories) or a [repi package](#repi-packages) to share with others. See [docs/skills.md](docs/skills.md).

### Extensions

<p align="center"><img src="docs/images/doom-extension.png" alt="Doom Extension" width="600"></p>

TypeScript modules that extend repi with custom tools, commands, keyboard shortcuts, event handlers, and UI components.

```typescript
export default function (repi: ExtensionAPI) {
  repi.registerTool({ name: "deploy", ... });
  repi.registerCommand("stats", { ... });
  repi.on("tool_call", async (event, ctx) => { ... });
}
```

The default export can also be `async`. repi waits for async extension factories before startup continues, which is useful for one-time initialization such as fetching remote model lists before calling `repi.registerProvider()`.

**What's possible:**
- Custom tools (or replace built-in tools entirely)
- Sub-agents and plan mode
- Custom compaction and summarization
- Permission gates and path protection
- Custom editors and UI components
- Status lines, headers, footers
- Git checkpointing and auto-commit
- SSH and sandbox execution
- MCP server integration
- Make repi look like Claude Code
- Games while waiting (yes, Doom runs)
- ...anything you can dream up

Place in `~/.repi/agent/extensions/`, `.repi/extensions/`, or a [repi package](#repi-packages) to share with others. See [docs/extensions.md](docs/extensions.md) and [examples/extensions/](examples/extensions/).

### Themes

Built-in: `dark`, `light`. Themes hot-reload: modify the active theme file and repi immediately applies changes.

Place in `~/.repi/agent/themes/`, `.repi/themes/`, or a [repi package](#repi-packages) to share with others. See [docs/themes.md](docs/themes.md).

### REPI Packages

Bundle and share extensions, skills, prompts, and themes via npm or git. REPI also loads upstream pi packages that publish a `package.json` `pi` manifest and import `@earendil-works/pi-*` APIs. Find packages on [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords%3Api-package).

> **Security:** REPI packages run with full system access. Extensions execute arbitrary code, and skills can instruct the model to perform any action including running executables. Review source code before installing third-party packages.

```bash
# Verified upstream pi package (goal mode is built into REPI)
repi install npm:pi-web-access

# Generic npm/git packages
repi install npm:@foo/repi-tools
repi install npm:@foo/repi-tools@1.2.3      # pinned version
repi install git:github.com/user/repo
repi install git:github.com/user/repo@v1      # tag or commit
repi install git:git@github.com:user/repo
repi install git:git@github.com:user/repo@v1  # tag or commit
repi install https://github.com/user/repo
repi install https://github.com/user/repo@v1  # tag or commit
repi install ssh://git@github.com/user/repo
repi install ssh://git@github.com/user/repo@v1 # tag or commit
repi remove npm:@foo/repi-tools
repi uninstall npm:@foo/repi-tools            # alias for remove
repi list
repi update                                   # update installed packages (skips pinned packages)
repi update --extensions                      # update installed packages only
repi update npm:@foo/repi-tools               # update one package
repi update --extension npm:@foo/repi-tools   # update one package
repi config                                   # enable/disable extensions, skills, prompts, themes
```

Packages install to `~/.repi/agent/git/` (git) or `~/.repi/agent/npm/` (npm). Use `-l` for project-local installs (`.repi/git/`, `.repi/npm/`). Git `@ref` values are pinned tags or commits; pinned packages are skipped by `repi update`, so use `repi install git:host/user/repo@new-ref` to move an existing package to a new ref. Git packages install dependencies with `npm install --omit=dev` by default, so runtime deps must be listed under `dependencies`; when `npmCommand` is configured, git packages use plain `install` for compatibility with wrappers. If you use a Node version manager and want package installs to reuse a stable npm context, set `npmCommand` in `settings.json`, for example `["mise", "exec", "node@20", "--", "npm"]`.
REPI does not manage the upstream `pi` command: `repi update pi` is rejected, and `repi update` only updates REPI packages. For compatibility, legacy `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` is pointed at the isolated REPI profile so upstream extensions do not silently write to `~/.pi` when launched by `repi`.

Create a package by adding an upstream-compatible `pi` key to `package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "my-repi-package",
  "keywords": ["pi-package", "repi-package"],
  "pi": {
    "extensions": ["./extensions"],
    "skills": ["./skills"],
    "prompts": ["./prompts"],
    "themes": ["./themes"]
  }
}
```

Without a `repi` manifest, repi auto-discovers from conventional directories (`extensions/`, `skills/`, `prompts/`, `themes/`).

See [docs/packages.md](docs/packages.md).

---

## Programmatic Usage

### SDK

```typescript
import { AuthStorage, createAgentSession, ModelRegistry, SessionManager } from "@pi-recon/repi-coding-agent";

const authStorage = AuthStorage.create();
const modelRegistry = ModelRegistry.create(authStorage);
const { session } = await createAgentSession({
  sessionManager: SessionManager.inMemory(),
  authStorage,
  modelRegistry,
});

await session.prompt("What files are in the current directory?");
```

For advanced multi-session runtime replacement, use `createAgentSessionRuntime()` and `AgentSessionRuntime`.

See [docs/sdk.md](docs/sdk.md) and [examples/sdk/](examples/sdk/).

### RPC Mode

For non-Node.js integrations, use RPC mode over stdin/stdout:

```bash
repi --mode rpc
```

RPC mode uses strict LF-delimited JSONL framing. Clients must split records on `\n` only. Do not use generic line readers like Node `readline`, which also split on Unicode separators inside JSON payloads.

See [docs/rpc.md](docs/rpc.md) for the protocol.

---

## Philosophy

REPI keeps the mature pi harness surfaces—extensions, skills, prompts, themes, RPC, SDK, MCP, and subagent-capable execution—but the product default is reverse/pentest execution rather than a generic coding assistant.

- **Execution over theater:** routes, tools, subagents, swarm lanes, runtime adapters, evidence ledgers, replay/proof loops, and verifier matrices should produce artifacts that can be rerun.
- **Env-first models:** use `REPI_AUTH_TOKEN`, `REPI_BASE_URL`, `REPI_MODEL`, and `REPI_MODEL_API` for Claude Code-style model switching; use `models.json` only when persistent multi-provider detail is needed.
- **Goal to completion:** `/goal` is built in, visible in TUI/RPC, survives compaction/session restore, and requires `goal_complete` after real verification.
- **Runtime adapters:** `re_runtime_adapter` infers CDP/tshark/Frida/binwalk/GDB/r2/pwntools runners from target shape and writes parsed artifacts into evidence/knowledge/memory.
- **Evidence graph:** `re_graph build` links commands, facts, artifacts, hypotheses, verification, and counter-evidence into a traceable task tree.
- **Proof loop:** `re_proof_loop` classifies proof gaps and emits a short verifier/compiler/replayer/autofix quick path before escalating to delegate/swarm/supervisor.
- **Bounded subagents:** swarm worker manifests preserve timeout/cancel/retry metadata so handoff merges remain auditable under long runs.
- **Extension-compatible, profile-isolated:** upstream pi packages can load, but state stays under `~/.repi/agent` and REPI never manages the user's upstream `pi` install or `~/.pi` profile.
- **No fake fallbacks:** if a capability is missing, report the evidence gap or use a real generic fallback path; do not present simulated exploit/reverse results as proof.

# Non-interactive with piped stdin
cat traffic.har | repi -p "提取 API、签名参数、状态机和 replay 命令"

# Named one-shot session
repi --name "firmware-auth-analysis" -p "审计固件认证链路并输出 proof loop"

# Different configured provider/model
repi --provider openai-compatible --model provider/model-id "分析 Web/API 授权状态机"

# Model with provider prefix (no --provider needed)
repi --model openai-compatible/provider-model "生成 exploit-lab 复现矩阵"

# Model with thinking level shorthand
repi --model sonnet:high "构建 pwn 目标的 leak→primitive→proof 路线"

# Limit model cycling
repi --models "claude-*,gpt-4o,provider/model-id"

# Passive/read-only mapping mode
repi --tools read,grep,find,ls -p "只读分析 src/ 的路由、鉴权和入口"

| `REPI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` | Override config directory (default: `~/.repi/agent`) |
| `REPI_CODING_AGENT_SESSION_DIR` | Override session storage directory (overridden by `--session-dir`) |
| `REPI_PACKAGE_DIR` | Override package directory (useful for Nix/Guix where store paths tokenize poorly; `PI_PACKAGE_DIR` remains a compatibility fallback) |
| `REPI_AUTH_TOKEN` | Env-only provider API key/token |
| `REPI_BASE_URL` | Env-only provider base URL |
| `REPI_PROVIDER` | Optional env-only provider id shown in footer; default `repi-env` |
| `REPI_MODEL` | Env-only model id |
| `REPI_MODEL_API` | `openai-compatible`, `openai-responses`, or `anthropic` |
| `REPI_CONTEXT_WINDOW` / `REPI_AUTO_COMPACT_WINDOW` | Env-only model context window; the latter mirrors Claude Code naming |
| `REPI_MAX_TOKENS` | Env-only model output cap |
| `REPI_SUBAGENT_MODEL` | Optional worker/subagent model id |
| `REPI_LOAD_BUILTIN_MODELS` | Set `1` to expose upstream pi's built-in model catalog; default is `0` |
| `REPI_OFFLINE` | Disable startup network operations, including update checks, package update checks, and install/update telemetry |
| `REPI_ALLOW_BROWSER_COOKIES` | Maps to `PI_ALLOW_BROWSER_COOKIES` for compatible browser/search extensions |
| `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` | Compatibility alias automatically pointed at `REPI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` by the launcher |
| `PI_CACHE_RETENTION` | Set to `long` for extended prompt cache (Anthropic: 1h, OpenAI: 24h) |
