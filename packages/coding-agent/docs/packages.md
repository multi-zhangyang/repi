# REPI Packages

REPI packages bundle extensions, skills, prompt templates, and themes so you can share them through npm or git. A package can declare resources in `package.json` under the `repi` key, or use conventional directories.

## Install and Manage

> **Security:** REPI packages run with full system access. Extensions execute arbitrary code, and skills can instruct the model to perform any action including running executables. Review source code before installing third-party packages.

```bash
repi install npm:@foo/bar@1.0.0
repi install git:github.com/user/repo@v1
repi install https://github.com/user/repo  # raw URLs work too
repi install /absolute/path/to/package
repi install ./relative/path/to/package

repi remove npm:@foo/bar
repi list                     # show installed packages from settings
repi update                   # update installed packages and reconcile pinned git refs
repi update --extensions      # update packages and reconcile pinned git refs only
repi update npm:@foo/bar      # update one package
repi update --extension npm:@foo/bar
```

These commands manage repi packages, not the repi CLI installation. To uninstall repi itself, see [Quickstart](quickstart.md#uninstall).
`repi update pi` is intentionally rejected in REPI product mode: REPI does not manage the upstream `pi` command, and `repi update` only reconciles REPI packages.

By default, `install` and `remove` write to user settings (`~/.repi/agent/settings.json`). Use `-l` to write to project settings (`.repi/settings.json`) instead. Project settings can be shared with your team, and repi installs any missing packages automatically on startup after the project is trusted.

Project package commands read project settings only when the project is trusted. Use `--approve` to trust project-local files for one command, or `--no-approve` to ignore them for one command.

To try a package without installing it, use `--extension` or `-e`. This installs to a temporary directory for the current run only:

```bash
repi -e npm:@foo/bar
repi -e git:github.com/user/repo
```

## Package Sources

REPI accepts three source types in settings and `repi install`.

### npm

```
npm:@scope/pkg@1.2.3
npm:pkg
```

- Versioned specs are pinned and skipped by package updates (`repi update`, `repi update --extensions`).
- User installs go under `~/.repi/agent/npm/`.
- Project installs go under `.repi/npm/`.
- Set `npmCommand` in `settings.json` to pin npm package lookup and install operations to a specific wrapper command such as `mise` or `asdf`.

Example:

```json
{
  "npmCommand": ["mise", "exec", "node@20", "--", "npm"]
}
```

### git

```
git:github.com/user/repo@v1
git:git@github.com:user/repo@v1
https://github.com/user/repo@v1
ssh://git@github.com/user/repo@v1
```

- Without `git:` prefix, only protocol URLs are accepted (`https://`, `http://`, `ssh://`, `git://`).
- With `git:` prefix, shorthand formats are accepted, including `github.com/user/repo` and `git@github.com:user/repo`.
- HTTPS and SSH URLs are both supported.
- SSH URLs use your configured SSH keys automatically (respects `~/.ssh/config`).
- For non-interactive runs (for example CI), you can set `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0` to disable credential prompts and set `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` (for example `ssh -o BatchMode=yes -o ConnectTimeout=5`) to fail fast.
- Refs are pinned tags or commits. `repi update` and `repi update --extensions` do not move them to newer refs, but they do reconcile an existing clone to the configured ref.
- Use `repi install git:host/user/repo@new-ref` to update settings and move an existing package to a new pinned ref.
- Cloned to `~/.repi/agent/git/<host>/<path>` (global) or `.repi/git/<host>/<path>` (project).
- When reconciliation changes the checkout, repi resets and cleans the clone, then runs `npm install` if `package.json` exists.

**SSH examples:**
```bash
# git@host:path shorthand (requires git: prefix)
repi install git:git@github.com:user/repo

# ssh:// protocol format
repi install ssh://git@github.com/user/repo

# With version ref
repi install git:git@github.com:user/repo@v1.0.0
```

### Local Paths

```
/absolute/path/to/package
./relative/path/to/package
```

Local paths point to files or directories on disk and are added to settings without copying. Relative paths are resolved against the settings file they appear in. If the path is a file, it loads as a single extension. If it is a directory, repi loads resources using package rules.

## Creating a REPI Package

Add a `repi` manifest to `package.json` or use conventional directories. Include the `repi-package` keyword for discoverability.

```json
{
  "name": "my-package",
  "keywords": ["repi-package"],
  "repi": {
    "extensions": ["./extensions"],
    "skills": ["./skills"],
    "prompts": ["./prompts"],
    "themes": ["./themes"]
  }
}
```

Paths are relative to the package root. Arrays support glob patterns and `!exclusions`.

### Gallery Metadata

The [package gallery](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords%3Arepi-package) displays packages tagged with `repi-package`. Add `video` or `image` fields to show a preview:

```json
{
  "name": "my-package",
  "keywords": ["repi-package"],
  "repi": {
    "extensions": ["./extensions"],
    "video": "https://example.com/demo.mp4",
    "image": "https://example.com/screenshot.png"
  }
}
```

- **video**: MP4 only. On desktop, autoplays on hover. Clicking opens a fullscreen player.
- **image**: PNG, JPEG, GIF, or WebP. Displayed as a static preview.

If both are set, video takes precedence.

## Package Structure

### Convention Directories

If no `repi` manifest is present, repi auto-discovers resources from these directories:

- `extensions/` loads `.ts` and `.js` files
- `skills/` recursively finds `SKILL.md` folders and loads top-level `.md` files as skills
- `prompts/` loads `.md` files
- `themes/` loads `.json` files

## Dependencies

Third party runtime dependencies belong in `dependencies` in `package.json`. Dependencies that do not register extensions, skills, prompt templates, or themes also belong in `dependencies`. When repi installs a package from npm or git, it runs `npm install`, so those dependencies are installed automatically.

REPI bundles core packages for extensions and skills. If you import any of these, list them in `peerDependencies` with a `"*"` range and do not bundle them: `@pi-recon/repi-ai`, `@pi-recon/repi-agent-core`, `@pi-recon/repi-coding-agent`, `@pi-recon/repi-tui`, `typebox`.

Other repi packages must be bundled in your tarball. Add them to `dependencies` and `bundledDependencies`, then reference their resources through `node_modules/` paths. REPI loads packages with separate module roots, so separate installs do not collide or share modules.

Example:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "shitty-extensions": "^1.0.1"
  },
  "bundledDependencies": ["shitty-extensions"],
  "repi": {
    "extensions": ["extensions", "node_modules/shitty-extensions/extensions"],
    "skills": ["skills", "node_modules/shitty-extensions/skills"]
  }
}
```

## Package Filtering

Filter what a package loads using the object form in settings:

```json
{
  "packages": [
    "npm:simple-pkg",
    {
      "source": "npm:my-package",
      "extensions": ["extensions/*.ts", "!extensions/legacy.ts"],
      "skills": [],
      "prompts": ["prompts/review.md"],
      "themes": ["+themes/legacy.json"]
    }
  ]
}
```

`+path` and `-path` are exact paths relative to the package root.

- Omit a key to load all of that type.
- Use `[]` to load none of that type.
- `!pattern` excludes matches.
- `+path` force-includes an exact path.
- `-path` force-excludes an exact path.
- Filters layer on top of the manifest. They narrow down what is already allowed.

## Enable and Disable Resources

Use `repi config` to enable or disable extensions, skills, prompt templates, and themes from installed packages and local directories. Works for both global (`~/.repi/agent`) and project (`.repi/`) scopes.

## Scope and Deduplication

Packages can appear in both global and project settings. If the same package appears in both, the project entry wins. Identity is determined by:

- npm: package name
- git: repository URL without ref
- local: resolved absolute path
