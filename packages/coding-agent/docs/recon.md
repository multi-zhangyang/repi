# REPI Kernel Profile

REPI includes a built-in reverse-engineering and pentest-oriented kernel profile. In this repository the recommended clean-room launcher is `repi`, which enables the profile and stores state under `~/.repi/agent` so it can coexist with normal upstream `pi`:

```bash
repi
repi --offline --help
repi --offline --list-models
```

The lower-level REPI flags are still available:

```bash
repi --recon
# alias:
repi --reverse-pentest
```

`--recon` is not just a prompt preset. It changes the runtime session wiring and installs a bottom-level execution contract: `refusal_to_execution` converts missing target/sample/credential/tool/context cases into `re_map`, `re_lane plan`, `fallback_commands`, `bootstrap plan`, a minimal repro script, or one precise gap question, and `operator_next_command_required` plus `operator_command_floor` keep every non-status turn tied to a concrete next command, tool call, artifact path, or repro command.

- sets thinking to `high` unless you explicitly choose another level
- replaces the base system prompt with the REPI execution model
- appends the REPI runtime protocol
- injects an inline extension factory before the agent starts
- registers reverse/pentest commands and LLM tools
- injects built-in skills and prompt templates even when no project `.repi` files exist
- persists REPI memory, executable mission lanes, mission blackboard, evidence ledger, and tool indexes under the active agent dir (`repi`: `~/.repi/agent/recon/`; raw `repi --recon`: `~/.repi/agent/recon/`)


## Execution-first false-refusal control

The kernel carries `authorized_task_bias`, `public_target_no_auto_refusal`, and `scope_gap_to_passive_mapping` as runtime contract markers, not just documentation. CTF/lab/owned/client-authorized/security-test context enters the execution chain by default. A public-looking hostname, brand, or production-like surface does not stop the task by itself; REPI first creates passive `re_map` evidence, route/auth baseline, live browser plan, `auth_context_gap`, `bounded_plan`, and `operator_queue`. If authorization context, accounts, window, or scope are incomplete, `authorization_context_missing` asks at most one path-changing question while still producing executable next commands.


## REPI auto-compaction threshold

REPI initializes `~/.repi/agent/settings.json` with an explicit top-tier harness policy instead of relying only on a fixed reserve-token buffer:

```json
{ "compaction": { "enabled": true, "triggerPercent": 85, "warningPercent": 80, "reserveTokens": 16384, "keepRecentTokens": 36000 } }
```

The runtime threshold is `compactionTriggerTokens = min(contextWindow * triggerPercent / 100, contextWindow - reserveTokens)`. Default upstream behavior without `triggerPercent` remains backward compatible: `contextWindow - reserveTokens`.

## Bootstrap and completion gates


Memory v5 makes long-term memory transactional before it becomes planner-actionable. `appendMemoryEvent` acquires `~/.repi/agent/recon/memory/.store.lock`, verifies `events.jsonl` parse/seq/prevHash/entryHash, writes a `MemoryAppendTransactionV1` manifest under `transactions/`, then atomically replaces `events.jsonl` and `case-memory.jsonl`; broken event chains block append instead of silently poisoning future planning. `re_memory verify` writes `store-report.json`, `re_memory repair-index` rebuilds `case-memory.jsonl` from the verified event chain, `re_memory snapshot` writes `store-snapshot.json` for cross-session recovery, and `re_memory eval` writes `usefulness-eval.json` with Memory usefulness eval metrics (`hitAt1`, `hitAtK`, `mrr`, `forbiddenLeakRate`, `forbiddenHitIds`). Replay, autofix, proof-loop, completion, reflection, manual memory, high-value `re_lane run`, and now `re_swarm run` worker results automatically write structured memory events, so successful runtime anchors, repairable failures, self-heal commands, verifier candidates, SubagentRuntimeManifestV1 rows, stdout/stderr hashes, claim ledger paths, structured claim merge paths, and worker routing hints survive compaction and future task planning. Swarm writeback rows are tagged `memory-swarm-writeback` and summarized in the `memory_swarm_writeback` formatter block. `re_memory events` shows recent structured rows, `re_memory vector` writes `vector-index.json` / `vector-search-report.json` with `MemoryEmbeddingProviderV1`: deterministic local `repi-local-hash-embedding-v1` is the default, and OpenAI-compatible embedding backends can be selected with `REPI_MEMORY_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=openai-compatible`, `REPI_MEMORY_EMBEDDING_BASE_URL`, `REPI_MEMORY_EMBEDDING_MODEL`, `REPI_MEMORY_EMBEDDING_API_KEY_ENV`, and explicit `REPI_MEMORY_EMBEDDING_ALLOW_REMOTE=1`; missing/disabled remote config falls back to local hash without storing literal keys. `re_memory quality` writes `quality-ledger.jsonl` / `quality-report.json` / `quality-board.md`, converting retrieval, vector hits, injection, feedback closure, usefulness hits/misses, forbidden leaks, scope blocks, and decay into MemoryQualityLedgerV11 `qualityScore` plus promote/retain/demote/quarantine/expire decisions. `re_memory search-events` writes `retrieval-report.json` and ranks by exact token match, Memory hybrid retrieval signals (`memory_semantic_hybrid_reuse`, `case-memory-hybrid`, `artifact-hybrid`), vector rerank (`memory_vector_rerank`), route/target match, `quality.confidence`, replay verification, reuse count, failure count, and decay. Route-scoped searches block cross-route command reuse, so authz/browser memory cannot accidentally inject pwn commands or the reverse. `re_lane run` also closes a Memory reuse feedback online loop: when a `memory-event:*` or `memory-sediment:*` command is executed, strong evidence appends a `memory_reuse_feedback_promote` event, while weak/nonzero evidence appends `memory_reuse_feedback_demote`; later retrieval folds case-level `reuseCount/failureCount/decay/replayVerified` into ranking and suppresses commands from failure-dominant cases. `re_memory feedback` writes `feedback-closure-report.json` so injected memories have an explicit MemoryFeedbackClosureV1 lifecycle: successful feedback produces `promotionReadyEventIds`, failed feedback produces `demotionRequiredEventIds` and supervisor demotion, and missing feedback remains in `pendingFeedbackEventIds` until writeback. `re_memory scope [target]` writes `scope-isolation-report.json` (`MemoryScopeIsolationV1`): same mission/session/workspace/branch/route/target memories are allow, cross-workspace/target/route memories are block/quarantine before sedimentation injection, cross-session/branch mismatches warn, and legacy memories without `MemoryScopeV1` require manual review. `re_memory artifact-scope-filter [target]` / `re_context pack [target]` write and embed `ArtifactScopeFilterV1`, applying the same scope verdict to latest artifact side-channel lookups so blocked run/browser/verifier artifacts are skipped before they enter `artifact_index`; `LatestArtifactConsumerScopeGateV1` extends that invariant to operator feedback, proof-loop gap/evidence/source, swarm bridge, and compiler claim gate latest-artifact consumers. `re_memory consolidate` summarizes latest `case-memory.jsonl` rows. `re_memory distill` writes `distillation-report.json`, `pattern-book.md`, and `quarantine.json`: high-confidence replayed events become `command_template`, `verifier_rule`, and `worker_routing_hint` patterns; the mandatory injection chain is `retrieve -> rank -> inject -> execute -> verify -> feedback`; cross-route/cross-target/contradicted/stale/failure-dominant cases enter `memory_contamination_quarantine` and cannot become promoted patterns. `re_memory sediment` writes `semantic-index.json`, `contradiction-ledger.jsonl`, `injection-packet.json`, and `sedimentation-report.json`, consuming `MemoryScopeIsolationV1` blockers before promotion; `re_memory supervise` writes `supervisor-report.json` and `lifecycle-board.md`, converting sedimentation into promotion/demotion/quarantine/expire/merge/retain queues with `quarantine_overrides_promotion`, `merge_by_case_signature`, and `feedback_required_after_injection`; `re_lane plan` refreshes that packet and injects only artifact-sha256-backed, replay/verifier-backed, non-quarantined rows with `memory_sedimentation_grade>=70`, emitting `memory-sediment:<eventId>:<n>` commands ahead of weaker recalls. `re_memory active` runs MemoryActiveKernelV14 and writes `active-kernel-report.json`, `active-injection-pack.json`, and `active-strategy-board.md`; it fuses sedimentation, quality, replay, strategy, feedback closure, and scope isolation into active decisions (`inject`, `reuse`, `verify`, `repair`, `avoid`, `quarantine`, `wait-feedback`, `expire`), produces operator/verifier/fallback/avoid commands plus compact-resume hints, and requires `active_kernel_feedback` writeback after injected or reused decisions. The write/shape contract is guarded by `schemas/reverse-agent/memory-event.schema.json`, `fixtures/reverse-agent/memory-event.fixture.json`, and `npm run gate:memory-contract`; utility is guarded by `npm run gate:memory-utility`; feedback behavior is guarded by `npm run gate:memory-feedback`; injected-memory feedback closure is guarded by `schemas/reverse-agent/memory-feedback-closure.schema.json`, `fixtures/reverse-agent/memory-feedback-closure.fixture.json`, and `npm run gate:memory-feedback-closure`; memory scope isolation is guarded by `schemas/reverse-agent/memory-scope-isolation.schema.json`, `fixtures/reverse-agent/memory-scope-isolation.fixture.json`, and `npm run gate:memory-scope-isolation`; artifact side-channel scope propagation is guarded by `schemas/reverse-agent/artifact-scope-filter.schema.json`, `fixtures/reverse-agent/artifact-scope-filter.fixture.json`, and `npm run gate:artifact-scope-filter`; latest artifact consumer propagation is guarded by `schemas/reverse-agent/latest-artifact-consumer-scope.schema.json`, `fixtures/reverse-agent/latest-artifact-consumer-scope.fixture.json`, and `npm run gate:latest-artifact-consumer-scope`; hybrid retrieval is guarded by `npm run gate:memory-hybrid`; vector rerank and embedding provider fallback are guarded by `schemas/reverse-agent/memory-vector.schema.json`, `fixtures/reverse-agent/memory-vector.fixture.json`, and `npm run gate:memory-vector`; Memory usefulness eval is guarded by `fixtures/reverse-agent/memory-usefulness.fixture.json` and `npm run gate:memory-usefulness`, covering authz/pwn hit@k, forbidden memory leakage, route isolation, and same-process and child-process concurrent append hash-chain pressure; MemoryQualityLedgerV11 is guarded by `schemas/reverse-agent/memory-quality-ledger.schema.json`, `fixtures/reverse-agent/memory-quality-ledger.fixture.json`, and `npm run gate:memory-quality-ledger`, covering positive-feedback promotion, negative-feedback demotion, pending feedback, append-only quality hash-chain, context pack embedding, and orchestrator wiring; MemoryActiveKernelV14 is guarded by `schemas/reverse-agent/memory-active-kernel.schema.json`, `fixtures/reverse-agent/memory-active-kernel.fixture.json`, and `npm run gate:memory-active-kernel`, covering replay-proven strategy injection, failed/quarantined memory avoid, pending feedback, active injection pack, and cross-session compact ready; distillation/quarantine behavior is guarded by `npm run gate:memory-distiller`; Memory v4 sedimentation behavior is guarded by `fixtures/reverse-agent/memory-sedimentation.fixture.json` and `npm run gate:memory-sedimentation`; Memory v5 store behavior is guarded by `fixtures/reverse-agent/memory-store.fixture.json` and `npm run gate:memory-store`, covering `hash_chain_verified_before_append`, transaction commit, `re_memory verify`, `re_memory repair-index`, `store-snapshot.json`, bad prevHash blocking, case index rebuild, and `memory_auto_writeback`; swarm worker writeback is guarded by `fixtures/reverse-agent/memory-swarm-writeback.fixture.json` and `npm run gate:memory-swarm-writeback`, covering `memory-swarm-writeback` event count, artifact capture, success/blocked outcomes, and plan/merge skip behavior; Memory Supervisor lifecycle governance is guarded by `schemas/reverse-agent/memory-supervisor.schema.json`, `fixtures/reverse-agent/memory-supervisor.fixture.json`, and `npm run gate:memory-supervisor`, covering report schema, lifecycle-board, promotion/demotion/quarantine/merge fixture, and runtime `re_memory supervise`.

`re_memory playbooks` generates `memory/playbooks/index.md` without moving files. `re_memory prune-playbooks` applies the maintenance policy (`minQuality`, `maxActive`, `maxAgeDays`) and moves low-quality, stale, or over-capacity playbooks to `memory/playbooks/archive/`.

`re_map` is the passive mapper gate: it runs a bounded local/target inventory, writes `evidence/maps/*.md`, appends an evidence ledger entry, and marks `passive_map_done`. Use it before expanding sideways so route files, auth/session strings, binary candidates, manifests, hashes, and URL headers are anchored in a single artifact. `re_lane plan` now consumes the latest map artifact: it adds `map-artifact-context`, records `map_reuse`, infers `map_inferred_target` when the user omitted a target, and hashes binary candidates parsed from the map.

Provider failure injection is guarded by `npm run gate:provider-failure-injection`. `ProviderFailureInjectionReportV1` launches real `repi --provider ... -p ...` calls against a local failing provider, covering HTTP 500, malformed OpenAI-compatible SSE, and Anthropic-compatible error events. The gate requires nonzero/failed exits, failure text capture, redacted request-log/transcript/stdout/stderr artifacts, canonical `FailureLedgerEventV1` / `RepairQueueItemV1` rows with shared signature and retryBudget, append-only writeback validation, and exhausted failures escalating instead of continuing blind retry.

Repair rollback policy is guarded by `npm run gate:repair-rollback-policy`. `RepairRollbackPolicyV1` executes a state-changing repair inside a temporary workspace, captures a baseline tree snapshot, restricts changed files to an allowlist, runs regression gates after repair, rolls back to the original state, and requires the restored tree hash to match the baseline. The gate links the repair to canonical `FailureLedgerEventV1` / `RepairQueueItemV1` rows and rejects baseline-missing, allowlist-violation, rollback-not-restored, missing-regression-gate, and failure/repair-unlinked cases.

Tool call trace ledger is guarded by `npm run gate:tool-call-trace-ledger`. `ToolCallTraceLedgerV1` records `tool_call` and `tool_result` runtime hooks into `~/.repi/agent/recon/evidence/tool-calls/tool-call-trace.jsonl` with append-only hashes, toolCallId, tool name, input/output sha256, redacted previews, result status, and replay hints. The gate triggers real extension hooks and rejects hash drift, literal secret leakage, result-without-call, missing output hash, and missing replay hints.

Provider runtime matrix is guarded by `npm run gate:provider-runtime-matrix`. `ProviderRuntimeMatrixV1` starts local mock OpenAI-compatible and Anthropic-compatible providers, writes isolated `~/.repi/agent/models.json` with env-ref-only API keys, runs `repi --list-models`, then launches real `repi --provider ... --model ... -p ...` calls for both APIs. The gate verifies streaming request paths (`/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/messages`), Authorization/x-api-key sourcing, redacted request-log/transcript/stdout/stderr hashes, no `.pi` profile leakage, no update banner, and negative cases for missing env-ref/wrong endpoint/list-models drift.

Parallel provider worker matrix is guarded by `npm run gate:parallel-provider-worker-matrix`. `ParallelProviderWorkerMatrixV1` starts multiple real `repi --provider ... --model ... -p ...` child workers concurrently against local OpenAI-compatible and Anthropic-compatible providers, including pass, HTTP 500 failure repair, and slow-provider timeout/cancel lanes. The gate verifies peak concurrency, `repi --list-models`, claim-aware provider worker merge, canonical failure/repair writeback, timeout cancellation, env-ref-only API keys, redacted request-log/transcript/stdout/stderr hashes, no `.pi` profile leakage, no update banner, and negative cases for serial execution, missing claim merge, unredacted secret, timeout without cancel, and missing repair.

Remote provider long-run is guarded by `npm run gate:remote-provider-longrun`. `RemoteProviderLongRunV1` is opt-in: without `REPI_REMOTE_PROVIDER_LIVE=1` it records skipped/pass so CI never requires provider secrets. With live enabled, configure `REPI_REMOTE_PROVIDER_API` (`openai-completions` or `anthropic-messages`), `REPI_REMOTE_PROVIDER_BASE_URL`, `REPI_REMOTE_PROVIDER_MODEL`, and `REPI_REMOTE_PROVIDER_API_KEY_ENV` / `REPI_REMOTE_PROVIDER_API_KEY`; the gate writes an isolated `~/.repi/agent/models.json` with env-ref-only keys, runs `repi --list-models`, then performs bounded multi-attempt `repi --provider ... --model ... --no-tools --no-session -p ...` calls. It verifies marker output, timeout bounds, session/profile isolation, secret redaction, no `.pi` profile leakage, no update banner, and canonical failure/repair writeback on live failures.

Worker child-session provider runtime is guarded by `npm run gate:worker-child-session`. The gate now has two live layers: `WorkerChildProcessProbeV1` starts isolated `repi --offline --help`, and `WorkerProviderChildProcessProbeV1` starts a local mock OpenAI-compatible provider, writes isolated `~/.repi/agent/models.json`, then runs `repi --provider child-openai-compatible --model child/mock-model --no-tools --no-session --thinking off -p ...`. Evidence includes redacted request-log, transcript, stdout/stderr hashes, env-ref-only API key validation, model/request validation, and no `.pi`/update-banner leakage checks.

Worker lease scheduler is guarded by `npm run gate:worker-lease-scheduler`. `WorkerLeaseSchedulerV1` now has live `re_swarm run` artifact wiring: each run writes `workerLeaseSchedulerPath` / `*-worker-lease-scheduler.json` with enqueue, lease, heartbeat, completed/failed, stale lease recovery probe, work stealing, duplicate completion rejection, claimRefs, artifactRefs, and append-only scheduler event hashes. The gate includes `runtime:worker-lease-scheduler-live-wiring` plus negative cases for hash drift, missing heartbeat, missing stale recovery, duplicate completion, missing claim refs, and max-concurrency assertion failure.

Repair rollback policy is guarded by `npm run gate:repair-rollback-policy`. `RepairRollbackPolicyV1` now has live `re_autofix` artifact wiring: state-changing `patch_queue` rows write `repairRollbackPolicyPath` / `*-repair-rollback-policy.json` with baseline snapshot, allowlist, regression gates, rollback restore proof, and rollback-type FailureLedgerEventV1 / RepairQueueItemV1 writeback. The gate includes `runtime:repair-rollback-live-wiring` plus negative cases for missing baseline, allowlist violation, rollback not restored, missing regression gate, and unlinked failure/repair rows.

`re_autopilot` / `/re-auto` is the bounded execution loop: `plan` shows the chain, while `run` creates/uses a mission, runs `re_map`, builds a lane command pack from the latest map and memory, emits `case_memory_lane_plan` from `case_memory_migrations` to reprioritize/add/skip lanes, emits a route/map/command-pack/tool-index-driven `bootstrap_plan`, derives an `execution_strategy`, executes the lane, runs bounded `[auto:*]` follow-ups, audits completion gates, and writes an autopilot field-journal checkpoint. Autopilot does not install packages by default; when tools are missing it first emits `fallback_commands` / skipped commands in `execution_strategy`, then prints `next_bootstrap_command` so the agent can deliberately run `/re-bootstrap plan|install ...` or choose an equivalent available tool.

`re_graph` / `/re-graph` is the engineering organization layer: it reads mission lanes/gates, latest passive map, lane run artifacts, evidence ledger and tool-index-derived gaps, writes `evidence/graphs/*.md`, and returns an `attack_graph` with `critical_path`, `gaps`, `operator_next_actions`, and `source_artifacts`. Use it after map/run/evidence updates and before widening scope so the next action is evidence-driven instead of ad hoc.

`re_lane` turns the mission blackboard into an executable queue: `next` selects work, `done` advances to the next lane and updates related gates, `block` records stuck lanes, and `add` creates ad-hoc subtasks. `plan` emits a lane-specific command pack for the active route and target and now searches `memory/playbooks/` plus `case-index.md` to merge similar historical commands, prioritizing higher `quality_score` playbooks that produced artifacts, anchors, follow-ups, and lane advances. `run` derives an `execution_strategy` from tool-index before execution, applies `fallback_commands` or skips commands whose tools are missing, then executes only commands that have concrete targets and no placeholders, writes a lane-run artifact, appends runtime evidence to the ledger, parses `tool repair anchors` and high-signal anchors such as addresses/compare symbols/routes/signing calls, emits an `evidence_quality` critic, queues `self_heal_commands` back into `[auto:*]` lane items when quality is thin, emits follow-up commands, and automatically advances the matching next lane when the run produced usable signal. `run-auto` then executes a bounded chain of `[auto:*]` follow-up commands already attached to active lanes, parses an `adaptive_decision` after every step, uses `evidence_quality` / `self_heal_commands` to continue the same lane, advance to the next lane, stop for bootstrap, or stop expansion, emits `multi_lane_plan` when repeated weak self-heal or stop decisions require lane repair, automatically adds or reprioritizes `tool-bootstrap`, `evidence-repair`, or `map-refresh`; `tool-bootstrap` emits `tool_bootstrap_closure`, refreshes tool-index, reports `missing_after_refresh` / `resumed_lane`, and resumes the original blocked lane once tools are closed; reports `adaptive_decisions` in the summary, and writes the successful chain into field journal, evolution log, and `memory/playbooks/` with score metadata, then refreshes/prunes the playbook index so future plans reuse strong chains instead of stale noise.

`re_lane plan` also invokes `specialist_runtime_planner` for top-tier reverse/pentest lanes: `browser/XHR/WS` capture, auth-diff, CDP-backed browser runtime artifact, request/response/WS/storage serialization, replay evaluator, route graph, auth matrix, IDOR/BOLA probe, authz state-machine, sequence replay, object ownership, and state rollback scaffolds for Web/API, `JS signing rebuild` hooks, observed normalizer, first-divergence, signed replay harness, and Node rebuild scaffolds for frontend signing, `pwn primitive` crash/GDB/cyclic offset/ROP-libc/local verifier/pwntools packs for exploit engineering, `exploit reliability/autopwn` packs with `exploit-poc-normalizer-scaffold`, `exploit-replay-matrix-scaffold`, `exploit-environment-pin-scaffold`, `exploit-flake-triage-scaffold`, and `exploit-artifact-bundle-scaffold`, `PCAP/DFIR` stream ranking/secret timeline/flow/object/carving/transform-chain packs for traffic and forensic artifacts, `Firmware/IoT rootfs` packs with `firmware-static-fingerprint-scaffold`, `firmware-extract-rootfs-scaffold`, `firmware-filesystem-config-secret-scaffold`, `firmware-service-surface-scaffold`, and `firmware-emulation-scaffold`, `agent prompt/tool boundary` packs with `agent-prompt-surface-map`, `agent-tool-boundary-scaffold`, `agent-memory-poisoning-scaffold`, `agent-injection-replay-harness`, and `agent-delegation-trace-scaffold`, `malware config/IOC` packs with `malware-static-triage-scaffold`, `malware-yara-capa-floss-scaffold`, `malware-ioc-config-scaffold`, and `malware-behavior-trace-scaffold`, `Cloud/K8s identity` identity/config/metadata/privilege-edge packs for cloud/container/K8s work, `Identity/AD graph` principal/credential/graph-edge packs for Windows/AD work, and `Frida/GDB trace` hook scaffolds for mobile/native runtime proof. These commands are still filtered through tool-index and `execution_strategy`, so missing tools produce fallback or bootstrap plans instead of blind execution.

`re_lane run` now includes a `tool repair analyzer` plus a `specialist evidence analyzer`: it parses specialist runtime transcripts into high-signal anchors and `targeted follow-ups` instead of treating stdout as opaque text. It recognizes `tool repair anchors`, `tool repair missing dependency anchors`, `browser/XHR/WS runtime anchors`, websocket endpoints, cookie/storage anchors, `browser CDP artifact anchors`, browser runtime artifact paths, `browser replay evaluator anchors`, `browser route graph anchors`, `browser auth matrix anchors`, `browser IDOR/BOLA probe anchors`, `browser authz state machine anchors`, `browser authz sequence replay anchors`, `browser authz object ownership anchors`, `browser authz state rollback anchors`, `JS signing rebuild anchors`, `crypto.subtle operation anchors`, `JS signing normalized artifact anchors`, `JS first-divergence anchors`, `JS signing replay harness anchors`, `pwn primitive crash/control anchors`, `pwn crash register anchors`, `pwn cyclic offset anchors`, `pwn ROP/libc chain anchors`, `pwn local verifier anchors`, and `pwn gadget anchors`, `Exploit PoC inventory anchors`, `PoC replay matrix anchors`, `Exploit environment pin anchors`, `Exploit flake triage anchors`, `Exploit artifact bundle anchors`, `PCAP/DFIR traffic flow anchors`, `PCAP stream ranking anchors`, `PCAP secret timeline anchors`, extracted PCAP artifacts, `PCAP transform chain anchors`, `Firmware image metadata anchors`, `Firmware extraction/rootfs anchors`, `Firmware config/secret anchors`, `Firmware service/web surface anchors`, `Firmware emulation/runtime anchors`, `Agent prompt surface anchors`, `Agent tool boundary anchors`, `Agent memory poisoning anchors`, `Agent injection replay anchors`, `Agent delegation trace anchors`, `Malware static triage anchors`, `Malware rule/capability anchors`, `Malware IOC/config anchors`, `Malware behavior trace anchors`, `Cloud identity anchors`, `Cloud/K8s runtime config anchors`, `Cloud metadata probe anchors`, `Cloud privilege edge anchors`, `Identity/AD principal anchors`, `Identity/AD credential usability anchors`, `Identity/AD graph edge anchors`, `Frida/GDB trace anchors`, and runtime hook return/value anchors, then queues tool-repair-matrix-scaffold/tool-repair-rerun/heal-tool-repair-matrix, browser auth-diff/capture reruns, browser CDP artifact reruns/reviews, browser replay evaluator reruns, browser route graph/auth matrix/IDOR-BOLA/authz-state reruns, browser authz state report, JS observed rebuilds, JS normalizer/first-divergence/replay harness reruns, pwn cyclic/GDB/offset/ROP-libc/local-verifier reruns, exploit poc/replay/env/flake/bundle/report reruns, PCAP stream ranking/secret timeline/follow-stream/object review/transform-chain, firmware-extract-rerun/firmware-config-secret-rerun/firmware-service-surface-rerun/firmware-report-scaffold, agent-prompt-surface-rerun/agent-tool-boundary-rerun/agent-memory-poisoning-rerun/agent-injection-replay-rerun/agent-delegation-trace-rerun/agent-security-report-scaffold, malware-static-triage-rerun/malware-ioc-config-rerun/malware-behavior-trace-rerun/malware-report-scaffold, cloud identity/runtime/metadata/privilege report reruns, identity-ad enum/credential/graph/report reruns, and Frida/GDB focused trace self-heal commands.

`re_bootstrap` turns the reverse-skill “missing tools → bootstrap → refresh tool-index” rule into an in-kernel tool. Use `plan` first to see exact commands, then `install` only for tools required by the active mission lane. After installation, REPI refreshes the tool index and updates the mission gate.

`re_complete` audits mission gates before a final claim. It checks route/memory/tool/passive-map/minimal-proof/evidence/repro/report/memory gates, evidence metadata, and journal/evolution state. `scaffold` writes a report draft under `~/.repi/agent/recon/reports/`.

## Project profile coexistence

A project or global `.repi/extensions/reverse-pentest-core.ts` profile can still exist. `repi` avoids those collisions by default with `--no-extensions --no-skills --no-prompt-templates --no-approve --no-context-files`; raw `repi --recon` also keeps the built-in inline kernel profile and suppresses conflicts from the legacy file-based REPI extension where possible.

## Examples

```bash
repi "分析这个 ELF 的许可证校验逻辑"
repi /reverse ./challenge
repi /websec http://127.0.0.1:3000
repi /jsre "抓包里的 sign 参数"
repi /cloud "K8s serviceaccount metadata privilege"
repi /identity "AD kerberos ldap bloodhound"
```

## Exploit Lab 稳定化层

`/re-exploit-lab plan|show|run|bundle` / `re_exploit_lab` 面向 exploit/PoC/autopwn 任务建立稳定化实验室。它输出 `exploit_lab` / `exploit_lab_artifact`、`lab_matrix`、`poc_inventory`、`environment_pins`、`replay_matrix`、`flake_triage`、`bundle_manifest`、`stability_anchors`、`lab_commands`、`lab_next_actions` 与 `next_lab_command`；artifact 写入 `.repi/evidence/exploit-lab/*.md` 并闭合 `exploit_lab_ready`。`run` 模式用本地 Python harness 或 `REPI_EXPLOIT_CMD` 做 bounded 多次 replay，记录 exit、duration、stdout/stderr SHA256、success_rate、stable/flake 结论和 bundle manifest。



## Mobile Runtime 动态逆向层

`/re-mobile-runtime plan|show|run` / `re_mobile_runtime` 面向 APK/Android/mobile reverse 任务建立 ADB/Frida/GDB 运行时捕获层。它输出 `mobile_runtime` / `mobile_runtime_artifact`、`device_matrix`、`apk_inventory`、`process_map`、`hook_plan`、`frida_hooks`、`native_trace`、`anti_debug_checks`、`runtime_anchors`、`replay_commands`、`capture_script`、`mobile_next_actions` 与 `next_mobile_command`；artifact 写入 `evidence/mobile-runtime/*.md` 并闭合 `mobile_runtime_ready`。`run` 默认只做观测和 hook 模板生成；需要真实 attach 时显式设置 `REPI_MOBILE_ATTACH=1`，并记录 Java crypto/String/native compare/anti-debug anchors。

## Decision Core 决策内核层

`/re-decision plan|show|tick|run` / `re_decision_core` 读取 mission gates、active lane、tool posture、artifact posture、evidence priority、execution kernel 与 context/operator/verifier/compiler/replayer/autofix/proof-loop/knowledge artifacts，输出 `decision_core` / `decision_artifact`、`objective_stack`、`gate_pressure`、`evidence_priority`、`tool_posture`、`artifact_posture`、`decision_rules`、`operator_queue`、`decision_next_actions`、`operator_next_command` 与 `next_decision_command`；artifact 写入 `.repi/evidence/decisions/*.md`，同时写入 `memory/decision-core.md` 并闭合 `decision_core_ready`。当下一步不清、上下文恢复、关键 artifact 更新或出现 narrative-only 倾向时，先 `re_decision_core tick <target>` 生成队列，再 `re_decision_core run <target> 1` bounded dispatch，最后进入 `re_proof_loop run <target> 4 2`。

## Exploit Chain 漏洞/利用链编排层

`/re-chain plan|show|compose` / `re_exploit_chain` 将 map、browser/XHR/WS、web_authz、native/mobile runtime、exploit_lab、verifier/compiler/replayer/autofix/proof-loop/knowledge artifacts 编排成 `exploit_chain` / `chain_artifact`，输出 `chain_nodes`、`chain_edges`、`proof_path`、`exploit_path`、`evidence_gaps`、`replay_commands`、`operator_queue`、`chain_next_actions` 与 `next_chain_command`；artifact 写入 `evidence/chains/*.md` 并闭合 `exploit_chain_ready`。

## Campaign graph

`/re-campaign plan [target]` / `re_campaign plan` 将单 lane 升级为跨域 campaign graph。它消费 mission、passive map、attack graph、lane run artifacts、evidence ledger、tool-index gaps，生成 `campaign_graph` 与 `campaign_artifact`，列出 `phases`、`pivot_candidates`、`evidence_gaps`、`tool_gaps`、`operator_next_actions`、`next_bootstrap_command`，并闭合 `campaign_plan_ready`。

## Operation queue

`/re-operation plan|next|run [target] [max-steps]` / `re_operation` 消费 `campaign_graph` / `campaign_artifact`，输出 `operation_queue` 与 `operation_artifact`。它把 phases 派生成 `phase_runner` steps，记录 `executed_steps`、`blocked`、`operator_next_actions`、`next_operation_command`，并闭合 `operation_queue_ready`。

## Specialist delegation

`/re-delegate plan|show|merge [target]` / `re_delegate` 消费 `operation_queue` / `operation_artifact` 与最新 `worker_scoreboard`，输出 `delegation_plan` 与 `delegation_artifact`。它把 operation steps 按 Web/Auth、Identity、Cloud、Pwn、Firmware/DFIR、AgentSec、Malware、Reporting 等 worker 拆分为 `worker_packets`，记录 `merge_queue`、`specialist_coverage`、`worker_scoreboard`、`adaptive_routing_hints`、`worker_promotion_queue`、`case_memory_migrations`、`evidence_contract`、`handoff`、`next_delegate_command`；低分 worker 自动补 evidence-repair/negative-control/replay 路由，高分 pass worker 推入 playbook promotion，并闭合 `delegation_packets_ready`。

## Swarm multi-agent orchestration

`/re-swarm plan|show|run|merge [target] [max-workers] [max-commands]` / `re_swarm` consumes `delegation_plan` / `delegation_artifact` and emits `swarm_plan`, `swarm_artifact`, `worker_runtime_packets`, run-mode `worker_executions`, `worker_results`, `blocked`, `merge_digest`, `memory_swarm_writeback`, plus `parallel_groups`, `merge_protocol`, `collision_matrix`, `evidence_contract`, `commander_next_actions`, and `next_swarm_command`; it closes `swarm_plan_ready`, writes each executed worker into MemoryStoreV5 as `memory-swarm-writeback` with SubagentRuntimeManifestV1/stdout/stderr/toolCallDigest/claim artifact refs, derives `workerChildSessionRuntimePath` / `*-worker-child-session-runtime.json` from those manifests, validates `WorkerChildSessionRuntimeBatchV1`, then bridges it into `WorkerRuntimePoolV1` for claim-aware merge validation. It writes `memory/swarm-run-board.md` in run mode, and in merge mode reads the latest run artifact so runtime `workerResults` / `blocked` / `mergeDigest` survive into `memory/swarm-board.md` without duplicating long-term memory rows.

Worker runtime hard-eval now has two layers: `WorkerRuntimePoolV1` (`npm run gate:worker-runtime-pool`) validates concurrency/resource/timeout/retry/claim-aware merge semantics, while `WorkerChildSessionRuntimeBatchV1` (`npm run gate:worker-child-session`) validates the independent child-session/provider runtime contract. Child sessions must launch through `repi --recon` with an isolated `.repi` home, provider credentials as env refs, update/telemetry disabled, transcript/stdout/stderr hashes, timeout/cancel, retryBudget, pool bridge, and claim ledger validation. The gate now also performs a live bounded `re_swarm run` probe plus `WorkerChildProcessProbeV1` actual `repi --offline --help` child process smoke, and requires `workerChildSessionRuntimePath`, `childSessionRuntimeCaptured=true`, `childProcessRuntimeCaptured=true`, `batchValidation.ok`, and `poolValidation.ok`.

Structured claim merge is the final-promotion layer: `StructuredClaimMergeV1` (`npm run gate:structured-claim-merge`) requires final pass claims to bind artifact sha256, JSON query, verifier pass, resolved adversary challenge, resolved conflict table, winner evidence, and loser downgrade. Runtime `re_swarm` now derives `*-structured-claim-merge.json` from `ClaimLedgerEventV1` and performs `structured_conflict_arbitration_live_wiring`: conflict rows are resolved by runtime evidence score, `winnerClaimId` is backed by `winningEvidenceRefs`, losers are written to `downgradeLosers` / blockedClaims, and loser claims cannot appear in finalClaims. `re_compiler final` and `re_complete audit` block on `structuredClaimMergeStatus=blocked` / `status=blocked_by_structured_claim_merge`, so worker text summaries or orchestration success cannot become final claims without evidence.

## Supervisor critic

`/re-supervisor review|show|repair [target]` / `re_supervisor` 消费 `delegation_plan` / `delegation_artifact` 与最新 `swarm_artifact`，输出 `supervisor_review` 与 `supervisor_artifact`。它对 `worker_packets` 和 swarm runtime 做 score/verdict/conflicts/evidence_gaps/repair_actions 评估，生成 `swarm_artifact`、`conflict_matrix`、`repair_queue`、`commander_merge_queue`、`commander_merge_budget`、`worker_scoreboard`、`priority_queue`、`next_supervisor_command`；`commander_merge_queue` 将 `worker_results` / `blocked` / `merge_digest` 推入 `re_context pack`、`re_operator dispatch`、`re_proof_loop run`，并写出 operator 可消费的 `commander_runtime_policy`，闭合 `supervisor_review_ready`。

## Reflection/evolution 闭环

`/re-reflect plan|show|write` / `re_reflect` 消费 `supervisor_review` / `supervisor_artifact`，输出 `reflection_cycle` 与 `reflection_artifact`。`write` 模式将 lessons、failure_patterns、reuse_rules、repair_playbook 写入 field journal、evolution log 和 `.repi/memory/playbooks/*.md`，并闭合 `reflection_memory_ready`。

## Context/resume pack 闭环

`/re-context pack|show|resume|resume-ledger` / `re_context` 消费 mission blackboard、evidence ledger、artifact_index、supervisor/reflect 结果、tool digest 与 memory tail，输出 `context_pack` 与 `context_artifact`。它把 `resume_brief`、`repair_queue`（含 supervisor 的 `commander_merge_queue`）、`commander_merge_budget`、`worker_scoreboard`、`reflection_reuse_rules`、`next_operator_commands` 和 `next_context_command` 固化到 `~/.repi/agent/recon/evidence/contexts/*.md`，并闭合 `context_pack_ready`，用于压缩、重启、handoff 后恢复连续逆向渗透作战。`ContextPackV2` / `ResumeContractV2` 现在包含 `createdAt`、`sessionId`、`cwd`、`workspaceRoot`、`resumeContract`、`contextSha256` 和 required artifact hash contract；MemoryStoreV5 / sedimentation 关键文件（`memory_events`、`memory_case_memory`、`memory_store_report`、`memory_store_snapshot`、`memory_usefulness_eval`、`memory_scope_isolation`、`artifact_scope_filter`、`memory_distillation_report`、`memory_injection_packet`、`memory_sedimentation_report`）存在时会作为 required artifact 检查，resume 时发生 drift 会 blocked。

Compact/resume chain hard-eval is covered by `npm run gate:compact-resume-chain`: it validates cross-session exact resume against `ContextPackV2` / `ResumeContractV2`, `contextSha256`, required artifact hashes, target/workspace/branch scope, append-only `compaction-resume-ledger.jsonl` `prevHash/entryHash`, queued→running→done resume transitions, proof-loop telemetry, and negative cases for drift, duplicate idempotency, invalid transitions, and exhausted/open closures. `CompactResumeLedgerV2` adds `memory/compaction-resume-transitions.jsonl` plus `memory/compaction-resume-ledger-v2-report.json`; `re_context resume-ledger` / `re_memory compact-resume` show the append-only transition ledger, `queued/running/done/blocked/exhausted` state, idempotent replay keys, and auto-resume budget. `npm run gate:compact-resume-ledger-v2` verifies that path with real `re_context pack/resume` runtime calls and context-pack embedding. `npm run gate:multi-compact-pressure` adds MultiCompactPressureGateV1 pressure coverage for repeated pack/resume cycles, explicit old contextPath over latest fallback, duplicate replay idempotency, target unresolved / scope mismatch / artifact drift negatives, and operator/proof-loop compact writeback. Runtime schema hard-eval is covered by `npm run gate:context-runtime-schema`: it creates a temporary REPI home, actually runs `re_mission new → re_map → re_memory verify/sediment → re_context pack → re_context resume`, parses the context artifact JSON, and verifies `contextSha256`, `resumeContract.contextSha256`, required memory artifact hashes, and closed `exactResumeVerification`. Runtime completion audit also verifies the compaction resume ledger before final completion.

## Operator queue 调度闭环

`/re-operator plan|show|dispatch|verify|escalate` / `re_operator` 消费 `context_pack` / `context_artifact` 中的 `next_operator_commands`，输出 `operator_queue` 与 `operator_artifact`。它按 `dispatcher_policy` 对 bootstrap/tool-index、map/plan、runtime/graph、campaign/operation/delegate/swarm、supervisor/reflect、context/memory、verifier/compiler、replayer/autofix、proof-loop、knowledge-graph、completion 分层排序，支持 bounded `dispatch`、`commander_runtime_policy`、`commander_dispatch_report`、`verification_matrix`、`escalation_queue`、`next_operator_command`，并在 commander failure_budget 耗尽时停止派发、保留 retry queue，闭合 `operator_queue_ready`。

## Verifier matrix 反证闭环

`/re-verifier check|show|matrix` / `re_verifier` 消费 `operator_queue` / `operator_artifact` 的 dispatch 结果，输出 `verifier_matrix` 与 `verifier_artifact`。它把每个执行结果转成 `assertions`、`evidence_bindings`、`counter_evidence`、`contradictions`、`gaps`、`operator_next_actions` 和 `next_verifier_command`，并闭合 `verifier_matrix_ready`，用于最终报告前的独立证据断言和反证检查。

## Compiler report 编译闭环

`/re-compiler draft|show|final` / `re_compiler` 消费最新 `verifier_matrix` / `verifier_artifact`，把 `proved`、`weak`、`contradicted`、`missing` 断言汇总为 `compiler_report` 与 `compiler_artifact`。输出包含 `key_evidence_block`、`repro_commands`、`contradictions`、`gaps`、`next_operator_queue`、`final_report_scaffold` 和 `next_compiler_command`；`final` 模式同时写入报告文件，并闭合 `compiler_ready` 与 `report_or_writeup_ready`。

## Replayer matrix 复现闭环

`/re-replayer plan|show|run` / `re_replayer` 消费最新 `compiler_report` / `compiler_artifact` 中的 `repro_commands`，把可直接执行的命令转成 bounded `replay_matrix`。`run` 模式逐条记录 `exit`、`stdout_sha256`、`stderr_sha256`、blocked/failed rows、`next_replay_actions` 与 `replay_artifact`，并闭合 `replay_ready`，用于证明报告里的复现命令仍可运行。

## Autofix repair 自动修复闭环

`/re-autofix plan|show|apply` / `re_autofix` 消费最新 `replay_matrix` / `replay_artifact` 的 failed/blocked rows，并合并 `compiler_report` 的 gaps/contradictions，生成 `autofix_plan` 与 `autofix_artifact`。输出包含 `patch_queue`、`command_substitutions`、`bootstrap_queue`、`evidence_recapture_queue`、`next_operator_queue` 和 `next_autofix_command`；`apply` 模式把修复队列写入 memory，并闭合 `autofix_ready`，之后应回到 `re_replayer run` 验证修复。

## Execution kernel 底层执行内核

`/re-kernel build|show|audit` / `re_kernel` 在任务启动或 profile/runtime 修改后生成 `execution_kernel` 与 `kernel_artifact`，输出 `directive_stack`、`refusal_to_execution_rules`、`domain_capabilities`、`tool_call_policy`、`artifact_contract`、`stall_recovery`、`operator_next_actions` 和 `next_kernel_command`。artifact 写入 evidence kernel 目录，同时写入 `memory/execution-kernel.md` 并闭合 `execution_kernel_ready`；后续 `re_map`、`re_lane`、`re_operator` 和 completion gates 按该底层执行内核推进。

## Proof loop 证明-复现-修复闭环

`/re-proof-loop plan|show|run` / `re_proof_loop` 把 `re_verifier matrix`、`re_compiler draft|final`、`re_replayer run`、`re_autofix plan|apply`、`re_knowledge_graph build` 和 `re_complete audit` 串成 bounded proof loop。输出 `proof_loop` / `proof_loop_artifact`、`verdict`、`gate_status`、`evidence_summary`、`specialist_queue`、`swarm_bridge`、`bridge_artifacts`、`steps`、`executed_steps`、`next_proof_actions` 与 `next_proof_command`；当 verdict 为 `partial`/`needs_repair` 时把 verifier/compiler/replayer/autofix/gate gap 分类为 web-authz、mobile-runtime、native-runtime、pwn-exploit、firmware-dfir、cloud、identity、agentsec、malware、reporting 或 general 专项 worker，并生成/执行 `re_delegate plan` → `re_swarm run` → `re_swarm merge` → `re_supervisor repair` 桥接；supervisor 再把 `commander_merge_queue` 注入 context/operator/proof-loop；artifact 写入 `.repi/evidence/proof-loops/*.md` 并闭合 `proof_loop_ready`。在 `re_decision_core run` 或 `re_operator dispatch` 后优先用 `re_proof_loop run <target> 4 2` 关闭 verifier→compiler→replayer→autofix 证据链。

## Knowledge graph 长期知识图谱闭环

`/re-knowledge-graph build|show|query` / `re_knowledge_graph` 汇总 `.repi/evidence/*` 下的 map、browser、run、attack_graph、campaign、operation、delegation、supervisor、reflection、context、operator、verifier、compiler、replayer、autofix artifacts，生成 `knowledge_graph` 与 `knowledge_artifact`。输出包含 `case_signatures`、`artifact_nodes`、`high_value_edges`、`similarity_index`、`worker_routing_hints`、`worker_scoreboard`、`adaptive_routing_hints`、`worker_promotion_queue`、`compact_resume_telemetry`、`compact_resume_case_memory`、`compact_resume_routing_hints`、`command_strategy_hints`、`knowledge_scope_isolation` 和 `next_knowledge_command`，同时写入 `memory/knowledge-graph-index.md` 并闭合 `knowledge_graph_ready`，用于跨任务迁移和相似案例检索。`KnowledgeScopeIsolationV1` 会读取 `memory/scope-isolation-report.json`，阻断 scope-blocked artifact 进入 `command_strategy_hints` / `similarity_index`，并由 `npm run gate:knowledge-scope-isolation` 保护；非 knowledge graph 的 latest artifact/context index 旁路由 `ArtifactScopeFilterV1` 保护，对应 `npm run gate:artifact-scope-filter`；operator/proof/compiler 的 latest artifact consumer 还由 `LatestArtifactConsumerScopeGateV1` / `npm run gate:latest-artifact-consumer-scope` 保护。

## REPI native-deep execution kernel update

- `execution_invariants` / `operator_command_floor` / `specialist_capability_matrix` / `proof_exit_criteria` 是 `re_kernel build` 的底层执行约束：任何安全/逆向/渗透任务必须落到 route→map→lane plan/run→runtime artifact→verifier/replayer/proof-loop，而不是 narrative-only。
- `native deep reverse/pwn` 专项会在 Native/Pwn/Mobile/CTF lanes 注入 `native-deep-symbol-map-scaffold`、`native-deep-decompiler-project-scaffold`、`native-deep-compare-trace-scaffold`、`native-deep-patch-hypothesis-scaffold`、`native-deep-symbolic-fuzz-scaffold`。
- `analyzeNativeDeepEvidence` 解析 `Native deep symbol/import/string anchors`、`Native decompiler/control-flow anchors`、`Native compare trace anchors`、`Native patch hypothesis anchors`、`Native symbolic/CFG anchors`、`Native fuzz/crash anchors`，并生成 `native-deep-symbol-map-rerun`、`native-deep-decompiler-rerun`、`native-deep-compare-trace-rerun`、`native-deep-symbolic-fuzz-rerun`、`native-deep-patch-report-scaffold`。
- native patch 必须先绑定 compare/branch runtime trace，再用 replay/verifier 证明输入约束或字节补丁；禁止无 artifact 的口头 patch 结论。


## REPI web-api authz deep update
- operation dispatcher now routes `re_live_browser`, `re_web_authz_state`, verifier, compiler, replayer, autofix, proof-loop, and knowledge graph commands from `operation_queue`.
- Web/API planner adds `web-api-authz-static-scaffold`, `web-api-schema-diff-scaffold`, and `web-api-state-source-scaffold` for route/source/schema authorization evidence.
- Analyzer parses `web API static authz source anchors`, `web API schema/auth parameter anchors`, and `web API state mutation source anchors`, then emits `web-api-authz-static-rerun`, `web-api-schema-diff-rerun`, and `web-api-state-source-rerun`.

## REPI swarm execution audit update
- `re_swarm plan|run|merge` now outputs `execution_audit`, `coverage_matrix`, and `retry_queue` for worker-runtime proof, contract coverage, and bounded repair.
- `re_supervisor review|repair` consumes these rows so worker promotion depends on executed commands, hashes/artifacts/anchors, and covered evidence contracts.

## REPI swarm retry operator bridge update
- Swarm `retry_queue` rows are promoted into `context_pack` as `swarm_retry_queue`, parsed into `next_operator_commands`, and surfaced in `commander_runtime_policy`.
- `re_proof_loop` now exposes `swarm_retry_queue` and can execute `swarm-retry` bridge steps before broader specialist repair.

## REPI operator feedback loop update

- `operator_feedback` is now a first-class verifier→compiler→replayer→autofix field, not a note: operator dispatch results are classified into `unresolved_target`, `dispatcher_gap`, `missing_tool_or_dependency`, `worker_retry_blocked`, `worker_retry_progress`, `runtime_failure`, `replay_or_exploit_candidate`, `strong_evidence`, `failure_budget_exhausted`, and `swarm_retry_queue`.
- `classifyOperatorFeedback` and `operatorFeedbackNextCommands` turn dispatch output into next commands: missing tools go to `re_bootstrap plan`, worker gaps go to bounded `re_swarm run`, runtime failures go to `re_autofix plan`, replay/exploit candidates go to `re_replayer run` or `re_exploit_lab run`, and strong evidence goes back to `re_verifier matrix`.
- `re_verifier`, `re_compiler`, `re_replayer`, and `re_autofix` must preserve `operator_feedback` so proof-loop repairs are driven by execution evidence rather than narrative-only judgment.

## REPI operator feedback proof/chain bridge update

- `latestOperatorFeedback` now collects `operator_feedback` from verifier/compiler/replayer/autofix artifacts and promotes executable `operator_feedback_queue` commands into the proof and chain layers.
- `re_proof_loop` exposes `operator_feedback` and `operator_feedback_queue`, appends bounded `operator-feedback` steps, treats unresolved target/missing tool/runtime failure/failure budget feedback as `needs_repair`, and runs feedback commands before broader swarm/specialist repair.
- `re_exploit_chain plan|compose` carries `operator_feedback` into `evidence_gaps`, `replay_commands`, `operator_queue`, and `proof_path` so exploitability claims inherit dispatcher failure signals instead of bypassing them.

## REPI operator feedback dispatcher fallback update

- `re_operator plan|dispatch` now imports `latestOperatorFeedback` directly into `operator_feedback`, `operator_feedback_queue`, and `dispatcher_fallback_plan` before context commands are sorted.
- `operatorFeedbackDispatchPlan` assigns dispatcher feedback priority: missing tools, unresolved targets, runtime/dispatcher failures, failure-budget exhaustion, swarm retry, replay/exploit candidates, and strong evidence each get bounded primary/fallback commands.
- Dispatch runtime results are reclassified immediately after bounded execution; `operator_feedback_runtime` updates `nextActions` so bootstrap/tool-index refresh, replay/autofix, swarm repair, proof-loop, and exploit-lab fallbacks can run without waiting for narrative review.

## REPI dispatcher feedback learning update

- `dispatcher_feedback_scoreboard` scores every operator feedback fallback command as passed, failed, or queued, then writes `memory/dispatcher-feedback-board.md` for cross-turn reuse.
- `dispatcher_learning_hints` turns those scores into `promote_dispatcher`, `demote_dispatcher`, or `retry_dispatcher` actions so successful repair routes are promoted and failed routes are rerouted through autofix/context repair.
- `re_knowledge_graph build` imports the dispatcher feedback board as `dispatcher_feedback_scoreboard` and `dispatcher_routing_hints`, adding dispatcher-feedback nodes and command strategy hints so future operator queues can reuse the best fallback path.

## REPI dispatcher learning case-memory update

- Dispatcher feedback now feeds `case_memory_migrations`: `Dispatcher routing hints`, `Dispatcher feedback scoreboard`, and `memory/dispatcher-feedback-board.md` are parsed as migration sources with elevated priority.
- `case_memory_lane_plan` treats `promote_dispatcher` as a high-score promotion signal and `demote_dispatcher` / `retry_dispatcher` as repair signals, so autopilot can skip low-value lanes, add `case-memory-repair`, or reprioritize the active lane from dispatcher learning.
- `re_delegate plan` and `re_knowledge_graph build` merge `dispatcherAdaptiveRoutingHints` and `dispatcherPromotionQueue` into worker routing/promotion so dispatcher success/failure affects worker promotion, demotion, and future command strategy.

## REPI autonomous dispatcher budget update

- `AutonomousExecutionBudget` is now a first-class execution-control artifact across `context_pack`, `re_operator`, `re_delegate`, `re_proof_loop`, and `re_knowledge_graph`: it exposes `maxTurns`, `maxDispatch`, `maxProofLoops`, and `maxWorkerRetries` instead of letting the commander drift across unbounded retries.
- `dispatcherScoreDecayRows`, `repeatedFailureDemotionRows`, and `highScorePromotionRows` convert `dispatcher_score` rows into explicit `score_decay`, repeated-failure demotions, and high-score route promotions.
- `writeDispatcherPromotionPlaybook` writes `memory/dispatcher-promotion-playbook.md`, and the knowledge graph / case-memory migration path imports `Autonomous execution budget`, `Dispatcher score decay`, `Repeated failure demotions`, and `High-score promotions` so later lanes reuse the strongest route and demote weak fallback loops.

## REPI autonomous budget ledger update

- `memory/autonomous-budget-ledger.md` now persists `autonomous_budget`, `score_decay`, `historical_score_decay`, demotions, promotions, and `nextActions` across turns so dispatcher/worker/lane scoring is not reset by context compaction.
- `latestAutonomousBudgetLedger`, `cumulativeDispatcherScoreDecayRows`, `workerScoreDemotionRows`, `autonomousLaneDemotionRows`, and `applyAutonomousBudgetDemotions` convert repeated dispatcher/worker failure pressure into automatic `autonomous-dispatcher-repair` lane demotion when thresholds are crossed.
- `writeFormalDispatcherPromotionPlaybook` promotes high-score dispatcher/worker routes into `memory/playbooks/*dispatcher-promotion*.md`, then `maintainPlaybooks` indexes them so `case_memory_migrations` can reuse formal playbooks, the autonomous budget ledger, and `memory/dispatcher-promotion-playbook.md` together.

## REPI owned compaction kernel update

Built-in REPI handles `session_before_compact` as a first-class compaction provider. It returns a `repi-recon-compaction` summary/details object, writes a `repi-recon-compaction-checkpoint`, and embeds the `context_path`, `re_context resume`, bounded `re_operator plan/dispatch`, `re_proof_loop run <target> 4 2`, `autonomous_execution_budget`, dispatcher score decay, repair queues, ledger/playbook paths, case memory, and artifact index. Resume logic should consume this RECON contract before relying on generic REPI compact text. After `session_compact`, REPI appends `repi-recon-compaction-resume-contract`, verifies fromExtension/details/context_path/resume/operator/proof-loop coverage, and updates the `compaction_resume_contract_ready` gate. A verified contract appends `repi-recon-compaction-auto-resume` and injects a `repi-recon-auto-resume` custom message with `triggerTurn` to run one bounded resume turn. `repi-recon-compaction-resume-telemetry` persists `compact_resume_command` queued/done/blocked state, proof-loop entry, output hashes, and gate status in `memory/compaction-auto-resume-board.md`; `CompactResumeLedgerV2` persists transition state in `memory/compaction-resume-transitions.jsonl` and `memory/compaction-resume-ledger-v2-report.json`, enforcing append-only hash, idempotencyKey replay dedupe and auto-resume budget; `MultiCompactPressureGateV1` / `npm run gate:multi-compact-pressure` pressure-tests that contract across multiple compact/resume rounds and negative exact-resume cases; `re_operator` imports it as `compact_resume_telemetry` / `compact_resume_queue`; `re_proof_loop` turns unresolved rows into `source=compact_resume` gaps, and `re_complete audit` treats queued/blocked resume commands, missing proof-loop entry, or compaction resume ledger hash drift as blockers. `re_knowledge_graph build` also promotes the telemetry into `compact_resume_case_memory`, `compact_resume_routing_hints`, and `compact_resume_status=*` signatures so compact recovery success/failure affects future case-memory routing; `re_autopilot plan|run` consumes those rows through `compactResumeCaseMemoryCommands`, creating `compact_resume_repair_from_case_memory` lanes for queued/blocked recovery or `compact_resume_success_skip_low_value_lane` handoffs after proof-loop success.

## Harness 自检与安装就绪

- `re_harness` / `/re-harness quick|full|install|show` 写入 `harness_artifact`，输出 `install_readiness`、`reverse_capability_guards`、`regression_guards`、registered tools/commands、存储可写性和 next_harness_command。
- `full` 用于每次 profile/extension/prompt/skill 修改后的回归；`install` 用于全局安装后的硬检查；`show` 读取最近 harness artifact。
- `reverse_capability_guards` 覆盖 native/web authz/mobile/exploit/proof loop/autopilot/compact/case-memory，明确守住 re_native_runtime、re_web_authz_state、re_proof_loop、compact_resume_case_memory、operator_command_floor、proof_exit_criteria、specialist_runtime_planner 等关键标记。


## MemoryOrchestratorV6

`re_memory orchestrate` 以及 `pre-task/pre-operator/post-tool/post-failure/post-success/pre-compact/post-compact/final` 动作会写入 `memory/orchestrator-report.json`。该报告把 memory 从旁路工具提升为主循环合同：pre-task retrieve before operator、scope filter before injection、post-tool writeback contract、pre-compact snapshot、post-compact resume injection、final supervise before claim。`re_context pack` 会嵌入该报告，`npm run gate:memory-orchestrator` 验证 schema、fixture 和 runtime context-pack embedding。

## MemoryDepositionEngineV7

`MemoryDepositionEngineV7` 把“记忆沉淀”从手工 append/report 升级成 runtime step event bus。REPI 的 `tool_result` hook 会自动捕获非 `re_memory` 工具结果；手工沉淀可用 `re_memory deposit command="..." artifactPath=/path "runtime evidence + lesson"`。每条 `deposition-events.jsonl` 记录 stage/source/status、command、stdout/stderr sha256、artifact hashes、MemoryEvent id、case signature、claimIds、compactResumeId、lessons/failure/reuse，并由 `deposition-report.json` 汇总 coverage、pending/blocked/skipped counters。`MemoryOrchestratorV6` 会读取该报告，`re_context pack` 会嵌入 `memoryDeposition` 和 artifact index 条目。`npm run gate:memory-deposition` 真实验证手工 deposit、模拟 `tool_result` 自动沉淀、append-only event bus、context-pack embedding 与 orchestrator wiring。

`MemoryExperienceEngineV8` 继续把“日志型沉淀”升级为“经验型沉淀”：`re_memory experience` 会从 `events.jsonl` 和 `deposition-events.jsonl` 生成 `experience-episodes.jsonl`、`experience-claims.jsonl`、`experience-promotions.jsonl`、`experience-lesson-book.md` 和 `experience-report.json`。它把 runtime result 建模为 Episode→Claim→Lesson→Promotion，成功命令进入 operator injection，失败命令进入 avoid/repair，冲突命令进入 `contradiction_resolution`，每条 lesson 带 `usefulness_backprop` 供后续 rerank。`MemoryOrchestratorV6` 增加 `experience_claim_lesson_promotion` step，`re_context pack` 嵌入 `memoryExperience`；`npm run gate:memory-experience` 真实验证 schema、fixture、promotion/demotion/conflict、operator injection、orchestrator wiring 和 context-pack embedding。

`MemorySkillCapsuleV9` 在 V8 之后继续做“经验资产化”：`re_memory skills` 会把 lesson / distilled pattern 编译成 `skill-capsules.jsonl`、`skill-capsule-report.json` 和 `skill-capsule-book.md`。每个 capsule 保留 source hash、evidence refs、promotion gate、operator/verifier/avoid commands 与 usefulness score；`MemoryOrchestratorV6` 增加 `skill_capsule_operator_injection` step，`re_context pack` 嵌入 `memorySkillCapsules`；`npm run gate:memory-skill-capsule` 真实验证 operator capsule、avoid capsule、verified promotion gate、context-pack embedding 和 orchestrator wiring。


#### MemoryQualityLedgerV11

`re_memory quality` 是长期记忆的质量闭环：它不改写 append-only `events.jsonl`，而是用独立 `quality-ledger.jsonl` 记录每次召回/注入/反馈后的质量观测，再由 `quality-report.json` 暴露当前每条 memory 的 `qualityScore`、生命周期决策和下一步命令。`search-events` 与 `sediment` 会读取最新 quality row，让好记忆更容易被复用，坏记忆自动降权或隔离。


### MemoryReplayEvaluatorV12

`re_memory replay` 是长期记忆的 A/B replay/causal attribution 层：它比较 no-memory control 与 memory-injected treatment，输出 saved-step delta、success lift、causal score 和 regression IDs，并让 MemoryQualityLedgerV11 消费 replay signal。运行 `npm run gate:memory-replay-evaluator` 验证 runtime/schema/fixture/context/orchestrator 接线。


### MemoryStrategyCapsuleV13

`re_memory strategy` 是长期记忆的可执行战术层：它消费 MemoryReplayEvaluatorV12、MemoryQualityLedgerV11 与 MemorySkillCapsuleV9，生成带触发条件、目标、推荐命令、验证命令、fallback、禁用命令和适用边界的 strategy capsule。运行 `npm run gate:memory-strategy-capsule` 验证 runtime/schema/fixture/context/orchestrator 接线。

### MemoryActiveKernelV14

`re_memory active` 是长期记忆的主动决策内核：它消费 sedimentation、MemoryQualityLedgerV11、MemoryReplayEvaluatorV12、MemoryStrategyCapsuleV13、feedback closure 和 scope isolation，输出 `active-kernel-report.json`、`active-injection-pack.json` 与 `active-strategy-board.md`。运行 `npm run gate:memory-active-kernel` 验证 replay-proven strategy 注入、candidate reuse、failed/quarantined memory avoid、pending feedback、active injection pack、orchestrator wiring 和 compact-resume hints。

### MemoryMaturationRuntimeV15

`re_memory mature` 是长期记忆的成熟闭环：它消费 MemoryDepositionEngineV7、MemoryExperienceEngineV8、MemorySkillCapsuleV9、MemoryStrategyCapsuleV13 与 MemoryActiveKernelV14，把 tool/runtime 结果从 `tool_result_to_strategy_loop` 推进到 `promote|retain|demote|quarantine|feedback-required|replay-required`。运行后写 `maturation-runtime-report.json`、`maturation-runtime-ledger.jsonl` 与 `maturation-action-board.md`；每行带 stagePath、prevHash/entryHash、feedbackCommands、retentionCommands、retentionScore、stalenessDays、replay-required gate、stale_memory_rehearsal_queue 和 compact-resume hints。运行 `npm run gate:memory-maturation-runtime` 验证 runtime `re_memory mature`、maturation hash chain、promotion/demotion/replay/feedback 策略、context/orchestrator wiring。


### StructuredClaimMergeV1 live gate

`npm run gate:provider-backed-dogfood` / `ProviderBackedDogfoodReleaseGateV1` 是 opt-in release quality gate：默认无 `REPI_PROVIDER_BACKED_DOGFOOD_LIVE=1` 时 skipped/pass；live 时运行 provider-backed `agent-dogfood/parallel-run.mjs`，要求非 plan-only artifact、至少两个 worker、synthesizer、真实 model/tool calls、subagent manifests、runtime claim ledger、non-mock runtime、parallel overlap 和 orchestration/platform split，负例阻断 plan-only promoted、single worker、missing model calls、missing synthesizer、missing claim ledger、non-mock false、secret leak。

`npm run gate:structured-claim-merge` 不只验证离线 fixture；它还执行 `runtime:structured-claim-live-wiring`，用 bounded `re_swarm run` 生成 runtime claim ledger 和 `*-structured-claim-merge.json`，确认 final pass claim 必须有 artifact sha256、JSON query、verifier pass；live conflict table 必须有 resolved `winnerClaimId`、`winningEvidenceRefs`、`downgradeLosers` 和 `structured_conflict_arbitration_live_wiring` marker；pending/blocked/loser worker claim 会保留为 blockedClaims，不能被文本摘要提升为最终结论。`npm run gate:runtime-claim-ledger` 同样会在缺少 source 时运行 bounded agent-dogfood plan-only native ledger、bounded `reSwarmLiveProbe` 与 compound-frontier use-latest native ledger，把 live `ClaimLedgerEventV1` 送入 strict adapter/validator；`runtimeLedgerQuality` 会输出 artifact sha256、event type count、tip hash、hash-chain 与 strict validator 摘要，可用 `--require-all-sources --require-promotion` 强制完整覆盖；`npm run gate:runtime-ledger-quality` / `RuntimeLedgerQualityGateV1` 会把这些摘要升级为独立 hard gate，并用缺 event/digest/validator 的负例保护。

### MemoryUxDashboardV16 user-visible memory UX

`re_memory status` / `re_memory dashboard` writes `memory/status-report.json` and `memory/status-board.md` so the operator can see store health, recall hits, quality/replay/active-kernel/maturation state, supervisor queues, and next commands without reading raw JSONL. `re_memory why <query>` exposes `recall_explainability`: each why row includes event id, case signature, score, reasons, commands, lessons, and governance commands. `re_memory promote <event-id>`, `re_memory demote <event-id>`, and `re_memory forget <event-id>` use `append_only_memory_governance`: they append feedback/tombstone events and `memory/governance-ledger.jsonl` rows rather than rewriting historical memory. The contract is `MemoryUxDashboardV16` with `user_visible_memory_status`, `recall_explainability`, `append_only_memory_governance`, and `lifecycle_governance_commands`; run `npm run gate:memory-ux` to validate the runtime status/why/promote/forget flow plus schema/fixture coverage.
