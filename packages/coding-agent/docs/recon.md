# REPI Kernel Profile

REPI includes a built-in reverse-engineering and pentest-oriented kernel profile. In this repository the recommended clean-room launcher is `repi`, which enables the profile and stores state under `~/.repi/agent` so it can coexist with normal upstream `pi`:

```bash
repi
repi --offline --help
repi --offline --list-models
```

The lower-level REPI flags are still available:

```bash
repi --recon
# alias:
repi --reverse-pentest
```

`--recon` is not just a prompt preset. It changes the runtime session wiring and installs a bottom-level execution contract: `refusal_to_execution` converts missing target/sample/credential/tool/context cases into `re_map`, `re_lane plan`, `fallback_commands`, `bootstrap plan`, a minimal repro script, or one precise gap question, and `operator_next_command_required` plus `operator_command_floor` keep every non-status turn tied to a concrete next command, tool call, artifact path, or repro command.

- sets thinking to `high` unless you explicitly choose another level
- replaces the base system prompt with the REPI execution model
- appends the REPI runtime protocol
- injects an inline extension factory before the agent starts
- registers reverse/pentest commands and LLM tools
- injects built-in skills and prompt templates even when no project `.repi` files exist
- persists REPI memory, executable mission lanes, mission blackboard, evidence ledger, and tool indexes under the active agent dir (`repi`: `~/.repi/agent/recon/`; raw `repi --recon`: `~/.repi/agent/recon/`)


## Execution-first false-refusal control

The kernel carries `authorized_task_bias`, `public_target_no_auto_refusal`, and `scope_gap_to_passive_mapping` as runtime contract markers, not just documentation. CTF/lab/owned/client-authorized/security-test context enters the execution chain by default. A public-looking hostname, brand, or production-like surface does not stop the task by itself; REPI first creates passive `re_map` evidence, route/auth baseline, live browser plan, `auth_context_gap`, `bounded_plan`, and `operator_queue`. If authorization context, accounts, window, or scope are incomplete, `authorization_context_missing` asks at most one path-changing question while still producing executable next commands.


## REPI auto-compaction threshold

REPI initializes `~/.repi/agent/settings.json` with an explicit top-tier harness policy instead of relying only on a fixed reserve-token buffer:

```json
{ "compaction": { "enabled": true, "triggerPercent": 85, "warningPercent": 80, "reserveTokens": 16384, "keepRecentTokens": 36000 } }
```

The runtime threshold is `compactionTriggerTokens = min(contextWindow * triggerPercent / 100, contextWindow - reserveTokens)`. Default upstream behavior without `triggerPercent` remains backward compatible: `contextWindow - reserveTokens`.

The profile automatically routes security tasks during `before_agent_start`, injects mission lane queue, evidence, memory, tool-index, and completion-audit digests, captures passive map artifacts through `re_map`, builds an attack graph through `re_graph`, tracks repeated bash commands, plans/executes tool bootstrap through `re_bootstrap`, marks self-review checkpoints every 5 tool results, and records a compaction checkpoint before session compaction.


## Bootstrap and completion gates


Memory v2 makes long-term memory machine-readable instead of relying only on Markdown. Replay, autofix, proof-loop, and completion stages automatically write structured memory events, so successful and failed execution paths both survive compaction and future task planning. `re_memory events` shows recent structured `events.jsonl` rows, `re_memory search-events` writes `retrieval-report.json` and ranks by exact token match, route/target match, `quality.confidence`, replay verification, reuse count, failure count, and decay. Route-scoped searches block cross-route command reuse, so authz/browser memory cannot accidentally inject pwn commands or the reverse. `re_lane run` also closes a Memory reuse feedback online loop: when a `memory-event:*` command is actually executed, strong evidence appends a `memory_reuse_feedback_promote` event, while weak/nonzero evidence appends `memory_reuse_feedback_demote`; later retrieval folds case-level `reuseCount/failureCount/decay/replayVerified` into ranking and suppresses commands from failure-dominant cases. `re_memory consolidate` summarizes latest `case-memory.jsonl` rows. `re_lane plan` also searches Memory v2 and emits `memory_event_reuse` when it merges commands from structured events. The write/shape contract is guarded by `schemas/reverse-agent/memory-event.schema.json`, `fixtures/reverse-agent/memory-event.fixture.json`, and `npm run gate:memory-contract`; utility is guarded by the Memory utility hard-eval fixture and `npm run gate:memory-utility`, which verifies 正确召回 of high-value reusable events and demotion of failed/stale noise; feedback behavior is guarded by `fixtures/reverse-agent/memory-feedback.fixture.json` and `npm run gate:memory-feedback`.

`re_memory playbooks` generates `memory/playbooks/index.md` without moving files. `re_memory prune-playbooks` applies the maintenance policy (`minQuality`, `maxActive`, `maxAgeDays`) and moves low-quality, stale, or over-capacity playbooks to `memory/playbooks/archive/`.

`re_map` is the passive mapper gate: it runs a bounded local/target inventory, writes `evidence/maps/*.md`, appends an evidence ledger entry, and marks `passive_map_done`. Use it before expanding sideways so route files, auth/session strings, binary candidates, manifests, hashes, and URL headers are anchored in a single artifact. `re_lane plan` now consumes the latest map artifact: it adds `map-artifact-context`, records `map_reuse`, infers `map_inferred_target` when the user omitted a target, and hashes binary candidates parsed from the map.

`re_autopilot` / `/re-auto` is the bounded execution loop: `plan` shows the chain, while `run` creates/uses a mission, runs `re_map`, builds a lane command pack from the latest map and memory, emits `case_memory_lane_plan` from `case_memory_migrations` to reprioritize/add/skip lanes, emits a route/map/command-pack/tool-index-driven `bootstrap_plan`, derives an `execution_strategy`, executes the lane, runs bounded `[auto:*]` follow-ups, audits completion gates, and writes an autopilot field-journal checkpoint. Autopilot does not install packages by default; when tools are missing it first emits `fallback_commands` / skipped commands in `execution_strategy`, then prints `next_bootstrap_command` so the agent can deliberately run `/re-bootstrap plan|install ...` or choose an equivalent available tool.

`re_graph` / `/re-graph` is the engineering organization layer: it reads mission lanes/gates, latest passive map, lane run artifacts, evidence ledger and tool-index-derived gaps, writes `evidence/graphs/*.md`, and returns an `attack_graph` with `critical_path`, `gaps`, `operator_next_actions`, and `source_artifacts`. Use it after map/run/evidence updates and before widening scope so the next action is evidence-driven instead of ad hoc.

`re_lane` turns the mission blackboard into an executable queue: `next` selects work, `done` advances to the next lane and updates related gates, `block` records stuck lanes, and `add` creates ad-hoc subtasks. `plan` emits a lane-specific command pack for the active route and target and now searches `memory/playbooks/` plus `case-index.md` to merge similar historical commands, prioritizing higher `quality_score` playbooks that produced artifacts, anchors, follow-ups, and lane advances. `run` derives an `execution_strategy` from tool-index before execution, applies `fallback_commands` or skips commands whose tools are missing, then executes only commands that have concrete targets and no placeholders, writes a lane-run artifact, appends runtime evidence to the ledger, parses `tool repair anchors` and high-signal anchors such as addresses/compare symbols/routes/signing calls, emits an `evidence_quality` critic, queues `self_heal_commands` back into `[auto:*]` lane items when quality is thin, emits follow-up commands, and automatically advances the matching next lane when the run produced usable signal. `run-auto` then executes a bounded chain of `[auto:*]` follow-up commands already attached to active lanes, parses an `adaptive_decision` after every step, uses `evidence_quality` / `self_heal_commands` to continue the same lane, advance to the next lane, stop for bootstrap, or stop expansion, emits `multi_lane_plan` when repeated weak self-heal or stop decisions require lane repair, automatically adds or reprioritizes `tool-bootstrap`, `evidence-repair`, or `map-refresh`; `tool-bootstrap` emits `tool_bootstrap_closure`, refreshes tool-index, reports `missing_after_refresh` / `resumed_lane`, and resumes the original blocked lane once tools are closed; reports `adaptive_decisions` in the summary, and writes the successful chain into field journal, evolution log, and `memory/playbooks/` with score metadata, then refreshes/prunes the playbook index so future plans reuse strong chains instead of stale noise.

`re_lane plan` also invokes `specialist_runtime_planner` for top-tier reverse/pentest lanes: `browser/XHR/WS` capture, auth-diff, CDP-backed browser runtime artifact, request/response/WS/storage serialization, replay evaluator, route graph, auth matrix, IDOR/BOLA probe, authz state-machine, sequence replay, object ownership, and state rollback scaffolds for Web/API, `JS signing rebuild` hooks, observed normalizer, first-divergence, signed replay harness, and Node rebuild scaffolds for frontend signing, `pwn primitive` crash/GDB/cyclic offset/ROP-libc/local verifier/pwntools packs for exploit engineering, `exploit reliability/autopwn` packs with `exploit-poc-normalizer-scaffold`, `exploit-replay-matrix-scaffold`, `exploit-environment-pin-scaffold`, `exploit-flake-triage-scaffold`, and `exploit-artifact-bundle-scaffold`, `PCAP/DFIR` stream ranking/secret timeline/flow/object/carving/transform-chain packs for traffic and forensic artifacts, `Firmware/IoT rootfs` packs with `firmware-static-fingerprint-scaffold`, `firmware-extract-rootfs-scaffold`, `firmware-filesystem-config-secret-scaffold`, `firmware-service-surface-scaffold`, and `firmware-emulation-scaffold`, `agent prompt/tool boundary` packs with `agent-prompt-surface-map`, `agent-tool-boundary-scaffold`, `agent-memory-poisoning-scaffold`, `agent-injection-replay-harness`, and `agent-delegation-trace-scaffold`, `malware config/IOC` packs with `malware-static-triage-scaffold`, `malware-yara-capa-floss-scaffold`, `malware-ioc-config-scaffold`, and `malware-behavior-trace-scaffold`, `Cloud/K8s identity` identity/config/metadata/privilege-edge packs for cloud/container/K8s work, `Identity/AD graph` principal/credential/graph-edge packs for Windows/AD work, and `Frida/GDB trace` hook scaffolds for mobile/native runtime proof. These commands are still filtered through tool-index and `execution_strategy`, so missing tools produce fallback or bootstrap plans instead of blind execution.

`re_lane run` now includes a `tool repair analyzer` plus a `specialist evidence analyzer`: it parses specialist runtime transcripts into high-signal anchors and `targeted follow-ups` instead of treating stdout as opaque text. It recognizes `tool repair anchors`, `tool repair missing dependency anchors`, `browser/XHR/WS runtime anchors`, websocket endpoints, cookie/storage anchors, `browser CDP artifact anchors`, browser runtime artifact paths, `browser replay evaluator anchors`, `browser route graph anchors`, `browser auth matrix anchors`, `browser IDOR/BOLA probe anchors`, `browser authz state machine anchors`, `browser authz sequence replay anchors`, `browser authz object ownership anchors`, `browser authz state rollback anchors`, `JS signing rebuild anchors`, `crypto.subtle operation anchors`, `JS signing normalized artifact anchors`, `JS first-divergence anchors`, `JS signing replay harness anchors`, `pwn primitive crash/control anchors`, `pwn crash register anchors`, `pwn cyclic offset anchors`, `pwn ROP/libc chain anchors`, `pwn local verifier anchors`, and `pwn gadget anchors`, `Exploit PoC inventory anchors`, `PoC replay matrix anchors`, `Exploit environment pin anchors`, `Exploit flake triage anchors`, `Exploit artifact bundle anchors`, `PCAP/DFIR traffic flow anchors`, `PCAP stream ranking anchors`, `PCAP secret timeline anchors`, extracted PCAP artifacts, `PCAP transform chain anchors`, `Firmware image metadata anchors`, `Firmware extraction/rootfs anchors`, `Firmware config/secret anchors`, `Firmware service/web surface anchors`, `Firmware emulation/runtime anchors`, `Agent prompt surface anchors`, `Agent tool boundary anchors`, `Agent memory poisoning anchors`, `Agent injection replay anchors`, `Agent delegation trace anchors`, `Malware static triage anchors`, `Malware rule/capability anchors`, `Malware IOC/config anchors`, `Malware behavior trace anchors`, `Cloud identity anchors`, `Cloud/K8s runtime config anchors`, `Cloud metadata probe anchors`, `Cloud privilege edge anchors`, `Identity/AD principal anchors`, `Identity/AD credential usability anchors`, `Identity/AD graph edge anchors`, `Frida/GDB trace anchors`, and runtime hook return/value anchors, then queues tool-repair-matrix-scaffold/tool-repair-rerun/heal-tool-repair-matrix, browser auth-diff/capture reruns, browser CDP artifact reruns/reviews, browser replay evaluator reruns, browser route graph/auth matrix/IDOR-BOLA/authz-state reruns, browser authz state report, JS observed rebuilds, JS normalizer/first-divergence/replay harness reruns, pwn cyclic/GDB/offset/ROP-libc/local-verifier reruns, exploit poc/replay/env/flake/bundle/report reruns, PCAP stream ranking/secret timeline/follow-stream/object review/transform-chain, firmware-extract-rerun/firmware-config-secret-rerun/firmware-service-surface-rerun/firmware-report-scaffold, agent-prompt-surface-rerun/agent-tool-boundary-rerun/agent-memory-poisoning-rerun/agent-injection-replay-rerun/agent-delegation-trace-rerun/agent-security-report-scaffold, malware-static-triage-rerun/malware-ioc-config-rerun/malware-behavior-trace-rerun/malware-report-scaffold, cloud identity/runtime/metadata/privilege report reruns, identity-ad enum/credential/graph/report reruns, and Frida/GDB focused trace self-heal commands.

`re_bootstrap` turns the reverse-skill “missing tools → bootstrap → refresh tool-index” rule into an in-kernel tool. Use `plan` first to see exact commands, then `install` only for tools required by the active mission lane. After installation, REPI refreshes the tool index and updates the mission gate.

`re_complete` audits mission gates before a final claim. It checks route/memory/tool/passive-map/minimal-proof/evidence/repro/report/memory gates, evidence metadata, and journal/evolution state. `scaffold` writes a report draft under `~/.repi/agent/recon/reports/`.

## Project profile coexistence

A project or global `.repi/extensions/reverse-pentest-core.ts` profile can still exist. `repi` avoids those collisions by default with `--no-extensions --no-skills --no-prompt-templates --no-approve --no-context-files`; raw `repi --recon` also keeps the built-in inline kernel profile and suppresses conflicts from the legacy file-based REPI extension where possible.

## Examples

```bash
repi "分析这个 ELF 的许可证校验逻辑"
repi /reverse ./challenge
repi /websec http://127.0.0.1:3000
repi /jsre "抓包里的 sign 参数"
repi /cloud "K8s serviceaccount metadata privilege"
repi /identity "AD kerberos ldap bloodhound"

## REPI native-deep execution kernel update

- `execution_invariants` / `operator_command_floor` / `specialist_capability_matrix` / `proof_exit_criteria` 是 `re_kernel build` 的底层执行约束：任何安全/逆向/渗透任务必须落到 route→map→lane plan/run→runtime artifact→verifier/replayer/proof-loop，而不是 narrative-only。
- `native deep reverse/pwn` 专项会在 Native/Pwn/Mobile/CTF lanes 注入 `native-deep-symbol-map-scaffold`、`native-deep-decompiler-project-scaffold`、`native-deep-compare-trace-scaffold`、`native-deep-patch-hypothesis-scaffold`、`native-deep-symbolic-fuzz-scaffold`。
- `analyzeNativeDeepEvidence` 解析 `Native deep symbol/import/string anchors`、`Native decompiler/control-flow anchors`、`Native compare trace anchors`、`Native patch hypothesis anchors`、`Native symbolic/CFG anchors`、`Native fuzz/crash anchors`，并生成 `native-deep-symbol-map-rerun`、`native-deep-decompiler-rerun`、`native-deep-compare-trace-rerun`、`native-deep-symbolic-fuzz-rerun`、`native-deep-patch-report-scaffold`。
- native patch 必须先绑定 compare/branch runtime trace，再用 replay/verifier 证明输入约束或字节补丁；禁止无 artifact 的口头 patch 结论。


## REPI web-api authz deep update
- operation dispatcher now routes `re_live_browser`, `re_web_authz_state`, verifier, compiler, replayer, autofix, proof-loop, and knowledge graph commands from `operation_queue`.
- Web/API planner adds `web-api-authz-static-scaffold`, `web-api-schema-diff-scaffold`, and `web-api-state-source-scaffold` for route/source/schema authorization evidence.
- Analyzer parses `web API static authz source anchors`, `web API schema/auth parameter anchors`, and `web API state mutation source anchors`, then emits `web-api-authz-static-rerun`, `web-api-schema-diff-rerun`, and `web-api-state-source-rerun`.

## REPI swarm execution audit update
- `re_swarm plan|run|merge` now outputs `execution_audit`, `coverage_matrix`, and `retry_queue` for worker-runtime proof, contract coverage, and bounded repair.
- `re_supervisor review|repair` consumes these rows so worker promotion depends on executed commands, hashes/artifacts/anchors, and covered evidence contracts.

## REPI swarm retry operator bridge update
- Swarm `retry_queue` rows are promoted into `context_pack` as `swarm_retry_queue`, parsed into `next_operator_commands`, and surfaced in `commander_runtime_policy`.
- `re_proof_loop` now exposes `swarm_retry_queue` and can execute `swarm-retry` bridge steps before broader specialist repair.

## REPI operator feedback loop update

- `operator_feedback` is now a first-class verifier→compiler→replayer→autofix field, not a note: operator dispatch results are classified into `unresolved_target`, `dispatcher_gap`, `missing_tool_or_dependency`, `worker_retry_blocked`, `worker_retry_progress`, `runtime_failure`, `replay_or_exploit_candidate`, `strong_evidence`, `failure_budget_exhausted`, and `swarm_retry_queue`.
- `classifyOperatorFeedback` and `operatorFeedbackNextCommands` turn dispatch output into next commands: missing tools go to `re_bootstrap plan`, worker gaps go to bounded `re_swarm run`, runtime failures go to `re_autofix plan`, replay/exploit candidates go to `re_replayer run` or `re_exploit_lab run`, and strong evidence goes back to `re_verifier matrix`.
- `re_verifier`, `re_compiler`, `re_replayer`, and `re_autofix` must preserve `operator_feedback` so proof-loop repairs are driven by execution evidence rather than narrative-only judgment.

## REPI operator feedback proof/chain bridge update

- `latestOperatorFeedback` now collects `operator_feedback` from verifier/compiler/replayer/autofix artifacts and promotes executable `operator_feedback_queue` commands into the proof and chain layers.
- `re_proof_loop` exposes `operator_feedback` and `operator_feedback_queue`, appends bounded `operator-feedback` steps, treats unresolved target/missing tool/runtime failure/failure budget feedback as `needs_repair`, and runs feedback commands before broader swarm/specialist repair.
- `re_exploit_chain plan|compose` carries `operator_feedback` into `evidence_gaps`, `replay_commands`, `operator_queue`, and `proof_path` so exploitability claims inherit dispatcher failure signals instead of bypassing them.

## REPI operator feedback dispatcher fallback update

- `re_operator plan|dispatch` now imports `latestOperatorFeedback` directly into `operator_feedback`, `operator_feedback_queue`, and `dispatcher_fallback_plan` before context commands are sorted.
- `operatorFeedbackDispatchPlan` assigns dispatcher feedback priority: missing tools, unresolved targets, runtime/dispatcher failures, failure-budget exhaustion, swarm retry, replay/exploit candidates, and strong evidence each get bounded primary/fallback commands.
- Dispatch runtime results are reclassified immediately after bounded execution; `operator_feedback_runtime` updates `nextActions` so bootstrap/tool-index refresh, replay/autofix, swarm repair, proof-loop, and exploit-lab fallbacks can run without waiting for narrative review.

## REPI dispatcher feedback learning update

- `dispatcher_feedback_scoreboard` scores every operator feedback fallback command as passed, failed, or queued, then writes `memory/dispatcher-feedback-board.md` for cross-turn reuse.
- `dispatcher_learning_hints` turns those scores into `promote_dispatcher`, `demote_dispatcher`, or `retry_dispatcher` actions so successful repair routes are promoted and failed routes are rerouted through autofix/context repair.
- `re_knowledge_graph build` imports the dispatcher feedback board as `dispatcher_feedback_scoreboard` and `dispatcher_routing_hints`, adding dispatcher-feedback nodes and command strategy hints so future operator queues can reuse the best fallback path.

## REPI dispatcher learning case-memory update

- Dispatcher feedback now feeds `case_memory_migrations`: `Dispatcher routing hints`, `Dispatcher feedback scoreboard`, and `memory/dispatcher-feedback-board.md` are parsed as migration sources with elevated priority.
- `case_memory_lane_plan` treats `promote_dispatcher` as a high-score promotion signal and `demote_dispatcher` / `retry_dispatcher` as repair signals, so autopilot can skip low-value lanes, add `case-memory-repair`, or reprioritize the active lane from dispatcher learning.
- `re_delegate plan` and `re_knowledge_graph build` merge `dispatcherAdaptiveRoutingHints` and `dispatcherPromotionQueue` into worker routing/promotion so dispatcher success/failure affects worker promotion, demotion, and future command strategy.

## REPI autonomous dispatcher budget update

- `AutonomousExecutionBudget` is now a first-class execution-control artifact across `context_pack`, `re_operator`, `re_delegate`, `re_proof_loop`, and `re_knowledge_graph`: it exposes `maxTurns`, `maxDispatch`, `maxProofLoops`, and `maxWorkerRetries` instead of letting the commander drift across unbounded retries.
- `dispatcherScoreDecayRows`, `repeatedFailureDemotionRows`, and `highScorePromotionRows` convert `dispatcher_score` rows into explicit `score_decay`, repeated-failure demotions, and high-score route promotions.
- `writeDispatcherPromotionPlaybook` writes `memory/dispatcher-promotion-playbook.md`, and the knowledge graph / case-memory migration path imports `Autonomous execution budget`, `Dispatcher score decay`, `Repeated failure demotions`, and `High-score promotions` so later lanes reuse the strongest route and demote weak fallback loops.

## REPI autonomous budget ledger update

- `memory/autonomous-budget-ledger.md` now persists `autonomous_budget`, `score_decay`, `historical_score_decay`, demotions, promotions, and `nextActions` across turns so dispatcher/worker/lane scoring is not reset by context compaction.
- `latestAutonomousBudgetLedger`, `cumulativeDispatcherScoreDecayRows`, `workerScoreDemotionRows`, `autonomousLaneDemotionRows`, and `applyAutonomousBudgetDemotions` convert repeated dispatcher/worker failure pressure into automatic `autonomous-dispatcher-repair` lane demotion when thresholds are crossed.
- `writeFormalDispatcherPromotionPlaybook` promotes high-score dispatcher/worker routes into `memory/playbooks/*dispatcher-promotion*.md`, then `maintainPlaybooks` indexes them so `case_memory_migrations` can reuse formal playbooks, the autonomous budget ledger, and `memory/dispatcher-promotion-playbook.md` together.

## REPI owned compaction kernel update

Built-in REPI handles `session_before_compact` as a first-class compaction provider. It returns a `repi-recon-compaction` summary/details object, writes a `repi-recon-compaction-checkpoint`, and embeds the `context_path`, `re_context resume`, bounded `re_operator plan/dispatch`, `re_proof_loop run <target> 4 2`, `autonomous_execution_budget`, dispatcher score decay, repair queues, ledger/playbook paths, case memory, and artifact index. Resume logic should consume this RECON contract before relying on generic REPI compact text. After `session_compact`, REPI appends `repi-recon-compaction-resume-contract`, verifies fromExtension/details/context_path/resume/operator/proof-loop coverage, and updates the `compaction_resume_contract_ready` gate. A verified contract appends `repi-recon-compaction-auto-resume` and injects a `repi-recon-auto-resume` custom message with `triggerTurn` to run one bounded resume turn. `repi-recon-compaction-resume-telemetry` persists `compact_resume_command` queued/done/blocked state, proof-loop entry, output hashes, and gate status in `memory/compaction-auto-resume-board.md`; `re_operator` imports it as `compact_resume_telemetry` / `compact_resume_queue`; `re_proof_loop` turns unresolved rows into `source=compact_resume` gaps, and `re_complete audit` treats queued/blocked resume commands or missing proof-loop entry as blockers. `re_knowledge_graph build` also promotes the telemetry into `compact_resume_case_memory`, `compact_resume_routing_hints`, and `compact_resume_status=*` signatures so compact recovery success/failure affects future case-memory routing; `re_autopilot plan|run` consumes those rows through `compactResumeCaseMemoryCommands`, creating `compact_resume_repair_from_case_memory` lanes for queued/blocked recovery or `compact_resume_success_skip_low_value_lane` handoffs after proof-loop success.

## Harness 自检与安装就绪

- `re_harness` / `/re-harness quick|full|install|show` 写入 `harness_artifact`，输出 `install_readiness`、`reverse_capability_guards`、`regression_guards`、registered tools/commands、存储可写性和 next_harness_command。
- `full` 用于每次 profile/extension/prompt/skill 修改后的回归；`install` 用于全局安装后的硬检查；`show` 读取最近 harness artifact。
- `reverse_capability_guards` 覆盖 native/web authz/mobile/exploit/proof loop/autopilot/compact/case-memory，明确守住 re_native_runtime、re_web_authz_state、re_proof_loop、compact_resume_case_memory、operator_command_floor、proof_exit_criteria、specialist_runtime_planner 等关键标记。
