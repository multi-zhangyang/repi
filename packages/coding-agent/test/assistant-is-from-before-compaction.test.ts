/**
 * opt #226 — isAssistantFromBeforeCompaction uses strict `<` (not `<=`) so a
 * same-millisecond assistant is NOT classified as stale.
 *
 * Pre-fix both compaction-guard sites used `assistantMessage.timestamp <=
 * compactionEntry.timestamp`. A post-compaction assistant sharing the
 * boundary ms (clock-granularity race — the compaction is often created in
 * the same ms as the assistant that triggered it) was wrongly classified as
 * pre-compaction → its overflow check was silently skipped.
